      D             Asus4 
1.Out the door just in time 
    G6      Asus4
Head down the Four-o-Five
      D             Asus4     G6      Asus4
Gotta meet the new boss by 8 a.m.
The phone rings in the car 
The wife is workin' hard 
She's running late tonight again.

Chorus:
Well, 
   Em                 Asus4 
I know what I've been told 
           Em           Asus4 
You gotta work to feed the soul 
      D             Asus4   E7  E
But I can't do this all on my own 
     G6       Asus4
No, I know I'm no Superman!

D Asus4 G6 Asus4 
         I'm no Superman!
D Asus4 G6 Asus4 

2.And you've got your love online 
You think you're doing fine 
But you're just plugged into the wall.
And that deck of tarot cards 
Won't get you very far 
There ain't no hand to break your fall.

Chorus:
Well, 
I know what I've been told 
You gotta know just when to fold,
But I can't do this all on my own 
No, I know I'm no Superman!

D Asus4 G6 Asus4 
         I'm no Superman!
D Asus4 G6 Asus4  
            That's right!

3.You've crossed the finish line
Won the race but lost your mind 
Was it worth it after all? 
I need you here with me 
'Cause love is all we need 
Just take a hold of the hand that breaks the fall.

Chorus:
Well, I know what I've been told 
Gotta break free to break the mold,
But I can't do this all on my own.
No, I can't do this all on my own.
I know that I'm no Superman!

D Asus4 G6 Asus4 
         I'm no Superman!
D Asus4 G6 Asus4 
         I'm no Superman!

   D    Asus4      G6  Asus4 
(Some day will be together) I'm no Superman!
   D   Asus4 G6 Asus4 
(Someday)
   D    Asus4      G6  Asus4 
(Some day will be together) 
   D   Asus4 G6 Asus4 
(Someday) 
I'm no Superman!
