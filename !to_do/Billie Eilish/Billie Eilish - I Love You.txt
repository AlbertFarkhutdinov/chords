[Verse 1]
     F
It's not true
                  Cmaj7
Tell me I've been lied to
             F         Cmaj7
Crying isn't like you, ooh
                  F
What the hell did I do?
                 C
Never been the type to
                F                Cmaj7
Let someone see right through, ooh


[Chorus]
F
Maybe won't you take it back?
    Dm
Say you were tryna make me laugh
    G
And nothing has to change today
    G7                        Am
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
     Cmaj7               F        Cmaj7
I love you and I don't want to, ooh


[Verse 2]
    F                    Cmaj7
Up all night on another red-eye
                 F               Cmaj7
I wish we never learned to fly high
                  F
Maybe we should just try
                     Cmaj7
To tell ourselves a good lie
               F              Cmaj7
Didn't mean to make you cry, I


[Chorus]
F
Maybe won't you take it back?
    Dm
Say you were tryna make me laugh
    G
And nothing has to change today
    G7                      Am
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
    Cmaj7                F       Cmaj7
I love you and I don't want to, ooh


[Bridge]
    Dm
The smile that you gave me
     G                    Cmaj7
Even when you felt like dying


[Outro]
   F
We fall apart as it gets dark
    Dm
I'm in your arms in Central Park
        G
There's nothing you could Do or say
  G7                       Am
I can't escape the way I love you
          Cmaj7          F        Cmaj7
I don't want to, but I love you, ooh
 F    Cmaj7
Ooh, ooh
 F    Cmaj7
Ooh, ooh
