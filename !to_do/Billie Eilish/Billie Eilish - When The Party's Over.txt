Capo 4
[Intro]
F

[Verse 1]
 F         Am        C       F
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
  F          Am              C          F
I've learnt to lose, you can't afford too
  F       Am       C           F
Tore my shirt to stop you bleeding
  F           Am    C       F
But nothing ever stops you leaving

[Chorus]
  F                      Am       C     F
Quiet when I'm coming home, I'm on my own
Dm                    Am                 C                  F
I could lie and say I like it like that, like it like that
Dm                    Am                 C                  F
I could lie and say I like it like that, like it like that

[Verse 2]
F         Am         C    F
Don't you know too much already?
  F         Am       C      F
I'll only hurt you if you let me
  F       Am          C       F
Call me friend, but keep me closer
  F          Am       C       F
But call me when the party's over


[Chorus]
    G           Am           C         F
Quiet when I'm coming home, I'm on my own
Dm                    Am                 C                  F
I could lie and say I like it like that, like it like that
Dm                    Am                 C                  F
I could lie and say I like it like that, like it like that

[Bridge]
Dm             Am          C      F
But nothing is better, sometimes
Dm           Am           C    F
Once we have said our goodbyes
G             F
Let's, let it Go
G              F
Let me let you Go

[Chorus]
F                       Am      C    F
Quiet when I'm coming home, I'm on my own
Dm                         Am            C           F
I could lie and say I like it like that, like it like that
Dm                  Am                     C              (F)
I could lie and say I like it like that, like it like that
