Somethin' in the...

                 Bbm
Somethin' in the air right now
                         G#5
Like I'm losin' track of time (Time, time)
                    F#
Like I don't really care right now
                 F7
But maybe that's fine
                 Bbm
You weren't even there that day
                G#5
I was waitin on you (You, you)
                      F#
I wonder if you aware away that day
             F7
Was the last straw for me
      Bbm              G#5
And I know I sent you flowers (Know, know)
             F#
Did you even care?
             F7
You ran the shower
                     Bbm
And left them by the stairs
        G#5             F#
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy, uhh
F7                                                 Bbm
Thought you had your shit together, but damn I was wrong

Bbm                           G#5
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause, cause)
                                    F#
And this ain't nothin' like it once was (Was, was)
                                   F7
I know you think you're such an outlaw
               Bbm
But you got no job (Job)
                             G#5
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause, cause)

                                   F7
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job

Bbm
I used to think you wеrе shy (shy)
G#5
Or maybe you just had nothing on your mind
F#                            F7
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time (time)
  Bbm
I used to wish you were mine (mine)
G#5
But that was way before I realized
F#                                  F7
Someone like you would always be so easy to find
Bbm                    G#5
(Um, um, so) So easy (easy, so, easy) 
F#                F7
Easy, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Bbm         G#5
Gave me no flowers
              F#
Wish I didn't care
                     F7
You'd been gone for hours
             Bbm   G#5            F#
Could be anywhere (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
  F7
I thought you would've grown eventually
                   Bbm
But you proved me wrong

Bbm                           G#5
