[Verse 2 Billie Eilish & Crooks]
Listen
Cm
Keep you in the dark, what had you expected
Cm
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected
Cm
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
Cm
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
Cm
Your talk'll be somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Cm
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
Cm
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Cm
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

[Bridge Billie Eilish & Crooks]
             Cm                         Gm
For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
                D7                         Gm
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
                 Cm 
Then my limbs all froze and my 
Gm
eyes won't close
           D7                   Gm
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful
