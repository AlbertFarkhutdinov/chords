Capo 3rd fret


[Intro]
Em  Am  B


[Verse 1]
Em
White shirt now red, my bloody nose, sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Am                                 B
Creepin' around like no one knows, think you're so criminal
Em
Bruises on both my knees for you, don't say thank you or please, I Do
Am                               B
What I want when I'm wanting to, my soul so cynical


[Chorus 1]
            Em
So you're a tough guy, like it really rough guy

Just can't get enough guy, chest always so puffed guy
         Am
I'm that bad type, make your mama sad type
                     B
Make your girlfriend mad tight, might seduce your dad type
N.C.
I'm the bad guy, duh
Em          Am      B
    I'm the bad guy


[Verse 2]
N.C.
I like it when you take control, even if you know that you don't
N.C.
Own me, I'll let you play the role, I'll be your animal
Em
My mommy likes to sing along with me, but she won't sing this song
Am                                  B
If she reads all the lyrics, she'll pity the men I know


[Chorus 2]
            Em
So you're a tough guy, like it really rough guy

Just can't get enough guy, chest always so puffed guy
         Am
I'm that bad type, make your mama sad type
                     B
Make your girlfriend mad tight, might seduce your dad type
N.C.
I'm the bad guy, duh
Em          Am      B
    I'm the bad guy,  duh
Em                         Am   B
    I'm only good at bein' bad, bad


[Interlude]
Em
   I like when you get mad
Em
   I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
Em
   You said she's scared of me, I mean
N.C.
I don't see what she sees but maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne


[Outro]
Em
   I'm a bad guy
Em
   I'm a bad guy
Em
   Bad guy, bad guy, I'm a bad
