[Intro]
N.C.
No, Billie, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
N.C.
There's a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to Do The Scarn


[Verse 1]
G#m               E  C#m             G#m
Don't ask questions, you don't wanna know
G#m            E  C#m           G#m
Learned my lesson way too long ago
       G#m                 E
To be talkin to you, belladonna
         C#m                    G#m
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
G#m                      E
Take what I want when I wanna
C#m                E
     And I want ya


[Pre-Chorus]
G#m       E
Bad, bad news
       C#m         G#m
One of us is gonna lose
         G#m                E
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
C#m
    Just add some friction


[Chorus]
G#m    C#m             G#m
Youuuu are my strange addiction
G#m    C#m             G#m
Youuuu are my strange addiction
G#m
My doctors can't explain
     C#m          G#m
My symptoms or my pain
    G#m    C#m
But youuuu are my strange addiction


[Interlude: The Office sample]
G#m                 E          C#m
      I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
   G#m                            G#m
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
                              E
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
           C#m                              G#m
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life


[Verse 2]
 G#m      E    C#m              G#m
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
   G#m     E
Be my reliever 'cause I don't self medicate
        G#m                    E
And it burns like a gin and I like it
          C#m                    G#m
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
 G#m                      E      C#m           G#m
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it (Teh)


[Pre-Chorus]
G#m       E
Bad, bad news
       C#m         G#m
One of us is gonna lose
         G#m                E
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
C#m
    Just add some friction


[Chorus]
G#m    C#m             G#m
Youuuu are my strange addiction
G#m    C#m             G#m
Youuuu are my strange addiction
G#m
My doctors can't explain
     C#m          G#m
My symptoms or my pain
    G#m    C#m
But youuuu are my strange addiction


[Bridge]
G#m       E          C#m     G#m
Bite my glass, set myself on fire
G#m                  E              C#m       G#m
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can't you tell I'm wired?
         G#m      E        C#m      G#m
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
          G#m     E             C#m    G#m
You could kiss my as-king about my motto


[Interlude: The Office sample]
G#m                  E             C#m     G#m
You should enter in festivals or carnivals
G#m                         E
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
        C#m  G#m
Pretty cool.......right?


[Chorus]
G#m    C#m             G#m
Youuuu are my strange addiction
G#m    C#m             G#m
Youuuu are my strange addiction
G#m
My doctors can't explain
     C#m          G#m
My symptoms or my pain
    G#m    C#m               G#m
But youuuu are my strange addiction


[Interlude]

G#m  E  C#m  G#m
