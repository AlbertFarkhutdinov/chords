[Intro]
Em  G


[Verse 1]
Em
Bite my tongue, bide my time, wearing a warning sign
G
Wait 'til the world is mine
Em
Visions I vandalize, cold in my kingdom size
G
Fell for these ocean eyes


[Chorus 1]
                       E5
You should see me in a crown
                           E5
I'm gonna run this nothing town, watch me make 'em bow
E5  G5  E5  G5  E5
One by  one by  one
E5  G5  E5  G5
One by  one by

                       E5
You should see me in a crown
                            E5
Your silence is my favorite sound, watch me make 'em bow
E5  G5  E5  G5  E5
One by  one by  one
E5  G5  E5  G5  N.C.
One by  one by  one


[Verse 2]
Em
Count my cards, watch them fall, blood on a marble wall
G                        N.C.
I like the way they all, scream
Em
Tell me which one is worse, living or dying first
G
Sleeping inside a hearse (I don't dream)


[Bridge]
Em
   You say, come over baby
  G
I think you're pretty
Em
   I'm okay, I'm not your baby
       G
If you think I'm pretty


[Chorus 2]
                       E5
You should see me in a crown
                           E5
I'm gonna run this nothing town, watch me make 'em bow
E5  G5  E5  G5  E5
One by  one by  one
E5  G5  E5  G5
One by  one by

                       E5
You should see me in a crown
                            E5
Your silence is my favorite sound, watch me make 'em bow
E5  G5  E5  G5  E5
One by  one by  one
E5  G5  E5  G5  E5
One by  one by  one
