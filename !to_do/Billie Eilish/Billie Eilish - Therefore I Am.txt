What the hell are you talking about 
                               A
Get my pretty name outta your mouth
                              A7
We are not the same with or without

Don't talk
 Dm
'bout me like how you might know how I feel

Top of the world, but your world isn't real
                 A7
Your world's an ideal
 
[Pre-Chorus]
           N.C.

And you can give 'em my best
 
But just know

Dm
I don't want press to put your name next to mine
 
We're on different lines so I
 A
Wanna be nice enough
 
They don't call my bluff
 
'Cause I hate to find
Dm
  Articles, articles, articles
 
I'd rather you remain unremarkable
                A
(Got a lotta) Interviews, interviews, interviews
 
When they say your name I just act confused
 
[Pre-Chorus]
             N.C.
Did you have fun?
 
I really couldn't care less
 
And you can give 'em my best but, just
 
No!
