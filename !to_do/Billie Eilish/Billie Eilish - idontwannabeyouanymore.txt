[Intro]
C G Am G

[Verse 1]
C
Don't be that way
      G
Fall apart twice a day
       Am                          G
I just wish you could feel what you say
C
Show, never tell
      G
But I know you too well
        Am                       D
Kind of mood that you wish you could sell

[Chorus]
   C
If teardrops could be bottled
           G
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
       Am                              B
Told a tight dress is what makes you a whore
      C
If "I love you" was a promise
          G
Would you break it, if you're honest
         Am                                 D
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
C         B       Em

[Verse 2]
C
Hands getting cold
       G
Losing feeling's getting old
      Am              G
Was I made from a broken mold?
C
Hurt, I can't shake
           G
We've made every mistake
     Am                    D
Only you know the way that I break

[Chorus]
   C
If teardrops could be bottled
           G
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
       Am                              B
Told a tight dress is what makes you a whore
      C
If "I love you" was a promise
          G
Would you break it, if you're honest
         Am                                 D
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
C         B

C         B
Idontwannabeyou
C         B           Em
