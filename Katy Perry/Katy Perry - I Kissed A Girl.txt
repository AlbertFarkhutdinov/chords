1.This was never the way i planned,
    F     E7
Not my intention. 
I got so brave, drink in hand,
Lost my discretion.
It's not what i'm used to,
Just want to try you on.
I'm curious, for you,
Caught my attention.


Chorus:
Am         C               Dm
I kissed a girl and I liked it.
                 F       E
The taste of her cherry chapstick.
I kissed a girl, Just to try it.
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.
It felt so wrong, It felt so right.
Don't mean i'm in love tonight.
I kissed a girl, And I liked it.
I liked it!

2.No, I don't even know your name,
It doesn't matter.
Your my experimental game,
Just human nature.
It's not what good girls do,
Not how they should behave.
My head gets so confused,
Hard to erase.

Chorus.

  F          Em
Us girls we are so magical,
  Am                      G
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable,
Hard to resist, so touchable.
To good to deny it.
  Dm
Ain't no big deal, Its innocent.

Chorus.
