 Dm               F             B   C
1.Days like this I want to drive away      
Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade
You chewed me up and spit me out, like I was poison in your mouth
You took my light, you drained me down, but that was then and this is now. Now look at me!

Chorus:
 Dm             F                    B                       C
This is the part of me that you're never gonna ever take away from me, no!
This is the part of me that you're never gonna ever take away from me, no!
Throw your sticks and your stones, throw your bombs and your blows - But you're not gonna break my soul!
This is the part of me that you're never gonna ever take away from me, no!

2.I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me
You ripped me off, your love was cheap was always tearing at the seams
I fell deep, you let me down, but that was then and this is now. Now look at me!

Chorus.

 C                        Dm    F                    C
Now look at me I'm sparkling a firework, a dancing flame
You won't ever put me out again I'm glowing, Oh, Whoa
So you can keep the diamond ring, It don't mean nothing anyway
 C
In fact you can keep everything, Yeah Yeah! Except for me!

Chorus. 

This is the part of me, No (Away from me)!
This is the part of me (me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me) No!
Throw your sticks and your stones, Throw your bombs and your blows But you're not gonna break my soul!
This is the part of me that you're never gonna ever take away from me, no!
