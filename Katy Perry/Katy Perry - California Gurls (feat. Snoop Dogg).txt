[Snoop Dogg:]
 Am B  C Dm
         Greetings loved ones
Let's take a journey!

[Katy Perry:]
 Am B        C Dm
1.I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees
The boys break their necks
Try'na to creep a little sneak peek (at us)

Pre-chorus:
 C                  Dm
You could travel the world
  B
But nothing comes close to the golden coast.
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love. Oooooh Oh Oooooh!

Chorus:
 Am  B                  C Dm
California girls We're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes, Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin So hot will melt your Popsicle
Ooh Oh Oh!
California girls We're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce, We got it on lock
West coast represent Now put your hands up
Ooh Oh Ooh!

2.Sex on a beach
We get my sand in our stilettos
We freak in my Jeep, 
Snoop Doggy dog on the stereo

Pre-chorus.
Chorus.

[Snoop Dogg:]
3.Tone Tan Fit and ready, Turn it up cause its gettin' heavy
Wild wild west coast These are the girls I love the most

I mean the ones I mean like she's the one, Kiss her, Touch her, Squeeze her
The girl's a freak, She drives a jeep The men on the beach
I'm okay, I won't play, I love the bay, Just like I love LA,
Venice beach and Palm Springs, Summer time is everything.
Come on boys Hanging out All that ass hanging out,
Bikinis, tankinis, martinis, No weenies, Just to get in betweeny
Katy, my lady (yeah)! You looking here baby (uh huh),
I'm all up on you, Cause you representing California (ohhh yeah)!

[Katy Perry:]
Chorus.
