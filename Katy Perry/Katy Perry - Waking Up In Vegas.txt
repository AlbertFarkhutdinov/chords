1.You gotta help me out
                      Dm
It’s all a blur last night
                       B 
We need a taxi cause you’re
                   F
Hung-over and I’m broke.

I lost my fake id but
You lost the motel key
Spare me your freaking dirty looks
               C Dm B
Now don’t play me
                    C Dm B
You want to cash out
And get the hell out of town
Don’t be a baby
  C
Remember what you told me

Chorus:
 F           C                B              C
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That’s what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now 
 F              C         B          Dm   C
That’s what you get for waking up in Ve-gas

2.Why are these lights so bright
Oh did we get hitched last night 
Dressed up like Elvis
And why why am I wearing your class ring?

Don’t call your mother
Cause now we’re partners in crime
Don’t be a baby
Remember what you told me

Chorus.

D#
You got me into this
 F           G            B       C
Information overload, situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S.

And get some cash out
We’re gonna tear up the town
Don’t be a baby  
                     F  C B               
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me told me told me heyyy!!!

Chorus.

That’s what you get baby
Shake the glitter shake shake
shake the glitter c’mon!
Give me some cash out baby
Give me some cash out baby
