Intro:|D|G|Hm|A|

   D          G
1.You sent a text
 Hm            A
It's like the wind changed your mind
We were best friends   
Yeah, we were building our life
With every kiss, and every letter
Every promise of forever, oh
But you hit send
And disappeared in front of my eyes

Chorus:
     D           G       Hm
And now you're just a ghost
                 A
When I look back never would have known that
You could be so cold
Like a stranger vanish like a vapor
   D                               G                
There's just an echo where your heart used to be
        Hm       A
Now I see it clearly
And there's just a pillow where your head used to sleep
My vision's twenty-twenty, I see through you now

2.Something has died
Now that I have made up my mind
I'll be alright
It doesn't haunt me at night
'Cause every gift, and  every letter, 
Every promise of forever
Now, it's out of sight
Like you were never alive

Chorus.

                  D                    G
I see through you now, now, now, now, now..
  Hm                 A
Now, now, now, now, now..
So rest in piece
I'll see you on the other side

Chorus.

I see through you now, now, now, now, now  Oh,
Now, now, now, now, now  
I see through you now ,now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
I see through you now!
