Intro:|Cadd9|Am|Cadd9|Am|G|

   Cadd9                    Am 
1.I heard you're feeling, nothing's going right.
 Cadd9                  Am   G
Why don't you let me, stop by
The clock is ticking, running out of time,
So we should party, all night.

So cover your eyes, I have a surprise.
I hope you got a healthy appetite.
If you wanna dance, if you want it all.
You know that I'm the girl that you should call.

Chorus:
     Cadd9                 Am
But when you're with me, I'll give you a taste
 Cadd9                      Am    G                                 
Make it like your Birthday everyday
I know you like it sweet, so you can have your cake
Give you something good to celebrate

Post-chorus:
So make (so make) a wish (a wish)
I'll make it like your Birthday everyday
I'll be (I'll be) your gift (your gift)
Give you something good to celebrate

2.Pop your confetti pop your perignon 
So hot and heavy 'till dawn
I got you spinning like a disco ball
All night they're playing your song

We're living the life, we're doing it right
You're never gonna be unsatisfied
If you wanna dance, if you want it all
You know that I'm the girl that you should call

Chorus.
Post-chorus.

So let me get you in your Birthday suit
It's time to bring out the big balloons
So let me get you in your Birthday suit         
It's time to bring out the big, big, big, big, big, big balloons

Chorus(x2).
