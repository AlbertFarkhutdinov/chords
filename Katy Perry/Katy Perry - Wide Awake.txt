          Gm B F C
I'm wide awake!
I'm wide awake!

              Gm                B
1.I'm wide awake! Yeah, I was in the dark
        F                   C
I was falling hard with an open heart
I'm wide awake! How did I read the stars
So wrong?
I'm wide awake and now it's clear to me 
That everything you see ain't always what it seems
I'm wide awake! Yeah, I was dreaming for 
So long

Pre-Chorus:
   Gm                          B
I wish I knew then, what I know now
   F                 C
Wouldn't dive in, wouldn't bow down
Gravity hurts you made it so sweet
Till I woke up on, On the concrete

Chorus:
 Gm        B       F C
Falling from cloud 9
Crashing from the high
I'm letting go tonight
Yeah I'm falling from cloud 9

2.I'm wide awake, not losing any sleep
I picked up every piece and landed on my feet
I'm wide awake, need nothing to complete 
Myself, no!
I'm wide awake! Yeah, I am born again
Outta the lion's den, I don't have to pretend
And it's too late, The story's over now,
The end.

Pre-Chorus.

Chorus.

Thunder rumbling, castles crumbling
I am trying to hold on
God knows that I tried, seeing the bright side
But I'm not blind anymore...
I'm wide awake!
I'm wide awake!

Chorus.

I'm wide awake!
I'm wide awake!
I'm wide awake!
I'm wide awake!
I'm wide awake!
