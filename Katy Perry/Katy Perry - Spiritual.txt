Intro:|G|Dm|B|Dm|

     G                 Dm
1.Lay me down at your altar, baby
 B                   Dm 
I'm a slave to this luck
       G                 Dm                B   Dm
Your electric lips have got me speaking in tales

I have prayed for a power like you
To see deep down in my soul
Oh, you make me bloom like a flower at desert road.

Pre-chorus:
 G                
Magic, or one, or mystery
 Dm            
All of you trying to work on me
 B                  Dm
I would surrender myself
Holy how, and heaven high
You will open up my eyes
And I'm finally here

Chorus:
 G       D#   B   F
This is spiritual, under your spell
Phenomenon, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, oh, at blow
Like a feather, you make me float
