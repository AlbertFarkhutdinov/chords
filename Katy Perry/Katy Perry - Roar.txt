Capo on 3rd fret

Intro:|G|G|

   G
1.I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
                            Am        Em
Scared to rock the boat and make a mess
                          C 
So I sit quietly, agree politely
I guess that I forgot I had a choice
I let you push me past the breaking point
I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

Pre-chorus:
    G                                              Am
You held me down, but I got up. Already brushing off the dust
     Em                                                       C
You hear my voice, you hear that sound like thunder, gonna shake the ground
You held me down, but I got up, get ready cause I've had enough
I see it all, I see it now

Chorus:
                     G                                     Am
I got the eye of the tiger, the fighter, dancing through the fire,
      Em                                 C 
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar!
Louder, louder than a lion,
Cause I am a champion and you're gonna hear me roar!
Oh oh oh...Oh oh oh...,
Oh oh oh...You're gonna hear me roar!

2.Now I'm floatin' like a butterfly
Stingin' like a bee I earned my stripes
I went from zero, to my own hero

Pre-chorus.

Chorus.

Oh oh oh (Hey)! Oh oh oh (You'll hear me roar)!
Oh oh oh! You're gonna hear me roar!

G Am Em D 
        Roar, roar, roar, roar!

Chorus.

Oh oh oh (Hey)! Oh oh oh (You'll hear me roar)!
Oh oh oh! You're gonna hear me roar!
