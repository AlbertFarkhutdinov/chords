  Em7    Cadd9         G                  Dadd11
1.Oh no, did I get too close?  Oh, did I almost 
See what's really on the inside?
All your insecurities, All the dirty 
Laundry, Never made me blink one time

Chorus:
        Em7 Cadd9       G   Dsus4 
Unconditional, unconditionally
I will love you unconditionally
There is no fear now. Let go and just be free
I will love you unconditionally

2.Come just as you are to me, Don't need apologies
Know that you are worthy 
I'll take your bad days with your good, Walk through this storm I would
I'd do it all because I love you, I love you.

Chorus.

                Em7                     Cadd9    
So open up your heart and just let it begin
             G                        Dsus4
Open up your heart, and just let it begin
Open up your heart, and just let it begin
             G
Open up your heart

Acceptance is the key to be to be truly free
Will you do the same for me?

Chorus.
