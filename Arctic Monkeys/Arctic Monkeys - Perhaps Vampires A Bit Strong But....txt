1.Well I've seen your eyes as they fix on me
What is he doing? What on earth's the plan? Has he got one? 
You'd better give me some pointers
Since you are the big rocket launcher and I'm just the shotgun

Well I ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes
That might be a surprise but it's true That I'm not like you 
And I don't want your advice Or your praise 
Or to move in the ways you do and I never will

Chorus:
Cause all you people are vampires
And all your stories are stale
And though you pretend to stand by us
I know you're certain we'll fail

2.Well I've seen your eyes as they fix on me
Full of confusion. Your snarl is just so condescending
Try to explain that we're onto a win
If the fee we get in near recoups what we're spending

He said, I can't believe that you drove all that way
Well how much did they pay ya? How much did they pay ya? 
You'd've been better to stay round our way
Thinking 'bout things but not actually doing THE THINGS

Chorus(x2).

All you people are vampires!
