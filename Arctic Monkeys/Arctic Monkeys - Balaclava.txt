1.Running off over next doors garden before the hour is done 
It's more a question of feeling than it is a question of fun 
The confidence is the balaclava, I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good 
Will the ending reek of salty cheeks and runny makeup alone 
Or will blood run down the face of a boy bewildered and scorned 
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish and you wish you'd never been born 
And you tie yourself to the tracks and there isn't no going back 
And it's wrong wrong wrong but we'll do it anyway cause we love a bit of trouble 

2.Are you pulling her from a burning building or throwing her to the sharks 
Can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start 
The confidence is the balaclava, I'm sure you baffle 'em straight 
And its wrong wrong wrong, she can hardly wait 

That's right, he won't let her out his sight 
Now the shaggers perform 
And the daggers are drawn 
Who's the crooks in this crime? 
That's right, he won't let her out his sight 
Now the shaggers perform 
And the daggers are drawn 
Who's the crooks in this.... Crime! 

That's right, he wont let her out his sight 
That's right, he wont let her out his sight 
That's right, he wont let her out his sight 
You'll be able to post any day of the most 
For the sights of all time 

3.You knew that it'd be trouble right before the very first kiss 
Quiet and assuming but you heard that they were the naughtiest 
She pleaded with you to take it off but you resisted and fought 
Sorry sweetheart, I'd much rather keep on the balaclava
