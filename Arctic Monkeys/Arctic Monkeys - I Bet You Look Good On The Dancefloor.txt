1.Stop making the eyes at me, I'll stop making the eyes at you 
And what it is that surprises me is that I don't really want you to 
And your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night) 
Oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite) 
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand 
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang, go!

Chorus:
I bet that you look good on the dancefloor 
I don't know if you're looking for romance or 
I don't know what you're looking for!
I said, I bet that you look good on the dancefloor 
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984,
From 1984! 

2.I wish you'd stop ignoring me, because it's sending me to despair 
Without a sound, yeah, you're calling me, and I don't think it's very fair 
That your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night) 
Oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite) 
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand 
Lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang, go! 

Chorus.

3.Oh, there ain't no love, no Montagues or Capulets 
Are just banging tunes and DJ sets and... 
Dirty dancefloors, and dreams of naughtiness! 

Chorus.
