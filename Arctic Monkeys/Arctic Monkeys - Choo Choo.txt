1.My baby wants to drive the train 
But don't you let her, don't you let her touch the tracks 
I said my baby wants to drive the train 
Well all aboard yeah, and don't forget to mind the gap 

Pre-Chorus:
Don't you let her, don't you know 
She's sick and tired of 
Being in the background, the passenger 
Let her drive the train, oh! 

Chorus:
Choo Choo! 
Why don't you let her drive the train? oh... 
Choo Choo! 
Why don't you let her drive the train, yeah 

2.She's setting off from platform four 
Make your way down, we'll shut the door bout quart to five 
I said she's setting off from platform four 
And they've decided that they're gonna let her drive 

Pre-Chorus.
Chorus.

Choo Choo! 
Choo Choo! 
Choo Choo! 
Choo Choo!
