1.If you can summon the strength, tow me 
I can't hold down the urgency 
You've got to make your decent slowly 
And oil up those sticky keys 

Chorus:
Coax me out, my love 
And have a spin of my propeller 

2.It's a necessary evil 
No cause for emergency 
Borrow the beak of a bald eagle 
Oh, momentary synergy 

Chorus:
Coax me out, my love 
Sink into tomorrow 
Coax me out, my love 
And have a spin of my propeller 

3.My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own 
When are you arriving? 
My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own 
When are you arriving? 
My propeller won't spin and I can't get it started on my own 
When are you arriving? 
My propeller!
