1.Anticipation has a habit to set you up 
For disappointment in evening entertainment but 
Tonight there'll be some love 
Tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah, regardless of what's gone before 
I want to see all of the things that we've already seen 
The lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine 
of course its fancy dress 
And they're all looking quite full on in bunny ears and devil horns in hell

For disappointment in evening entertainment but 
Tonight there'll be some love 
Tonight there'll be a ruckus yeah, regardless of what's gone before 
I want to see all of the things that we've already seen 
I want to see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine 
And put it all back in 
You've got to understand it you can never beat the bandit, no 

Chorus:
And she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked 
When she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock 
And there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox 
And all that it says is that you've drank a lot 
You should bear that in mind tonight 
Bear that in mind, yeah you should 
Bear that in mind tonight 
Bear that in mind 
You can pour your heart out but her reasoning will block 
Owt you send her after nine o'clock

You can pour your heart out around 3 o clock 
When the 2 for 1's undone the writers block.
