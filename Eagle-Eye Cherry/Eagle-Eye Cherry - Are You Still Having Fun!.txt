Intro(x4):|G#m|C#m|E|E|

                   G#m     C#m         E
1.You are on your own, you do as you please
Having so much fun gone and lost your reason
After all is said and done
Are you still having fun?
How was you to know when you've gone astray?
That happiness would go like a lost emotion
You have always gone your way
Are you happy today?

Chorus:
          G#m               C#m    E
Well you know when you've been defeated
You don't care and you thank no one
Feeling low you will always need it
Well, Are you're having fun?

 C#m E       F#
   You don't know what is it you've done
   You don't know that...

2.This was your mistake with the master plan
With all the drugs you take, you can hardly stand
After all is said and done
Are you still having fun?

Chorus:
Well you know when you've been defeated
You don't care and you thank no one
Feeling low you will always need it
Well, Are you're having fun?
Are you still having fun?

You don't know what it is you've done
Just to show that you're having fun
You don't know what it is you've done
Just to show that...

3.I can set you straight if you let me stay
I hope I'm not too late No you wont regret it
I can show you the way
And make you happy today

Chorus:
Yes, you know when you've been defeated
You don't care and you thank no one
Feeling low you will always need it
Well, you know when you're being cheated
Yes, you know when you've been defeated
Feeling low you will always need it
Now you're having fun...
And are you still having fun?
And are you still having fun?
And are you still having fun?
