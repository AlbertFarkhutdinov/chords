Intro(x2):|F|Dm|Am|Am|
 
   F                          Dm
1.I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard 
 Am
I wish I had a better voice and sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think
            F             Dm               Am
My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think.
My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think.

Chorus:
 F              Em           Am        E
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
  Am         G        C                  E
When our mommas sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
 Am             G            C         E
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
  Am         G        C                  E
When our mommas sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out

Interlude(x2):|F|Dm|Am|Am|

   Am                             G
2.Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
    Dm                       C
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only ever sell one
I'd give it to my brother because we have the same nose
Same clothes, home grown, the stones thrown from the creek we used to roam
F                            Dm
But it would remind of when nothing really mattered
 Am
Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the ladder

My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface, and I care what you think

Chorus.

    Am                              G
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
         C                                 E
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face saying 
"Wake up you need to make money"
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face saying 
"Wake up you need to make money"

Chorus.

     F                       Dm
We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
    Am
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd it fly far away
Used to dream of outer space but now they're laughing at our face saying 
"Wake up you need to make money"
