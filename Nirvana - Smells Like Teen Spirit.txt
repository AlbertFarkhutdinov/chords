1.Load up on guns and bring your friends 
It's fun to lose and to pretend 
She's over bored and self assured 
Oh no, I know a dirty word 

Pre-chorus:
Hello, hello, hello, how low? (x3) 
Hello, hello, hello! 

Chorus:
With the lights out, it's less dangerous 
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious 
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto! An albino!
A mosquito! My libido!
Yeah! (x3) 

2.I'm worse at what I do best 
And for this gift I feel blessed 
Our little group has always been 
And always will until the end 

Pre-chorus.
Chorus.

3.And I forget just why I taste 
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile 
I found it hard, it's hard to find 
Oh well, whatever, never mind 

Pre-chorus.
Chorus.

A denial!!! (x9)
