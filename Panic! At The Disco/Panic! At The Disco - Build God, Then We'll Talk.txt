Build God, Then We'll Talk

It's these substandard motels on the (lalalalala) corner of 4th and Freemont Street
Appealing only because they are just that un-appealing
Any practiced catholic would cross themselves upon entering
The rooms have a hint of asbestos and maybe just dash a of formaldehyde
And the habit of decomposing right before your very lalalala eyes.

Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

Tonight tennants range from: a lawyer and a virgin
Accessorizing with a rosary tucked inside her lingerie
She's getting a job at the firm come Monday
The Mrs. will stay with the cheating attorney
Moonlighting aside, she really needs his money
Oh what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

Yeah (Yeah)

And not to mention the constable and his proposition for that "virgin"
Yes, the one the lawyer met with on "strictly business"
as he said to the Mrs. Well only hours before
After he had left, as she was fixing her face in a compact
There was a terrible crash (There was a terrible crash)
Between her and the badge
She spilled her purse and her bag, and held a "purse" of a different kind

Along with the people inside
What a wonderful caricature of intimacy
Inside, what a wonderful caricature of intimacy

There are no...
raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
Its sleeping with roaches and taking the shit,
(shit) on the sheets and before all the stains
and a few more of your least favorite things

Raindrops on roses and girls in white dresses
and it's sleeping with roaches and taking the shit
(shit) on the sheets and before all the stains
And a few more of your least favorite things.
