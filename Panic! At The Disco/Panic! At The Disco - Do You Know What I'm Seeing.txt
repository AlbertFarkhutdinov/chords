Intro:|D#|D#|D#|D#|

    D#
1.Clouds are marching along, singing a song, just like they do.
If the clouds were singing a song, I'd sing along, wouldn't you too?
            G#m
If you just knew, what they could do? Oh, If you just knew, what would they do?
           D#                                   D#m
And if the birds are just hollow words, flying along, singing a song.
                G#m
What would they do, if they just knew? What they could do, oh if they just knew?

Chorus:
           F#
I know it's sad, that I never gave a damn about the weather
       D#m                     H
And it never gave a damn about me.
           F#
I know it's sad, that I never gave a damn about the weather
       D#m                     G#m
And it never gave a damn about me.
      D#m                     G#m
No, it never gave a damn about me.

Interlude:|G#m|G|F#|Fm|E|

Post-Chorus:
            G#m      G          F#               Fm              E
I know it's mad, but if I go to hell, will you come with me or just leave?
I know it's mad, but if the world were ending would you kiss me or just leave me?
       E
Just leave me?

2.Clouds are singing a song, marching along, just like they do.
If the clouds were playing a song, I'd play along, wouldn't you too?
            G#m
If you just knew, what they could do? Oh, If you just knew, what would they do?
And if words are just hollow birds, flying along, singing a song.
What would they do, if they just knew? What we could do, oh if they just knew?

Chorus.

Post-Chorus.

Chorus:
I know it's sad, that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me.
I know it's sad, that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me.
I know it's sad, that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me.
I know it's sad, that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me.
      D#m                     H
No, it never gave a damn about me.
