1.When she says she needs more than a friend
That's all I ever been, eee!
One day you gonna overstand 
Yo badu badee badu badee-dee.
I remember the first time that we met, yo!
How could I forget, yo!
When you smiled and I turned and said to you, yo!
You're pure and true!

I'm in love with you, in love with you!

I'm in love with you, in love with you, yeah!

I'm so in love baby
I don't care what your mama say.
I'm so in love baby
And I don't care what your sister say.
And I try, and I try, 
And I try, and I try,
And I try, and I try,
And I try, and I try,

2.She said he's really diggin me
I don't know what to say
I can't imagine why I feel 
So weak, say, say!
And then took my heart in her hands
I know that you were meant to be
My solder so baby come on
I mean it desperately.

Chorus.
