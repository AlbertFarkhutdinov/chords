Вступление(x2):|Em|Am|G7|C7|

    Em    Am          G7        C7
1.Load up on guns, bring your friends 
It's fun to lose and to pretend 
Shes over bored and self assured 
Oh no, I know a dirty word.

Pre-chorus:
  Em    Am      G7        C7
Hello, hello, hello! How low?
Hello, hello, hello! How low?
Hello, hello, hello! How low?
Hello, hello, hello!

Chorus:
    Em    Am           G7        C7
With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us.
I feel stupid and contagious 
Here we are now entertain us.
A mulatto, an albino,
A mosquito, my libido.

Post-chorus:
Em Am    G7 C7
    ААА!!!
Em Am    G7 C7
    EEE!!!

2.Im worse at what I do best 
And for this gift I feel blessed 
Our little tribe has always been 
And always will until the end

3.And I forget just why I taste 
Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile.
I found it hard, it was hard to find 
Oh well, whatever, nevermind.
