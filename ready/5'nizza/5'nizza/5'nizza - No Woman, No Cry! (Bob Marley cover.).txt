Вступление(x2):|C|G|Am|F|

      C      G       Am      F
1.Say I remember when we used to sit
In a government yard in Trenchtown.
Oba, Observing the hypocrites 
Mingle with the good people we meet 
Good friends we have, Oh, good friends we've lost
Along the way
In this great future, you can't forget your past 
So dry your tears, I see.

Припев:
  C  G     Am F
No woman, no cry.
No woman, no cry.
Little sister, don't she'd no tears                 
No woman, no cry.

2.Said I remember when we used to sit
In the governmentyard in Trenchtown
And then Georgie would make the fire lights
I seh, log would burning' thru the nights
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
Of wich I'll share with you
My feet is my only carriage
And so I've got to push on thru, Oh, while I'm gone

Everything's gonna be alright! Everything's gonna be alright!
Everything's gonna be alright now! Everything's gonna be alright!
Everything's gonna be alright! Everything's gonna be alright!
Everything's gonna be alright now! Everything's gonna be alright!

Припев.
