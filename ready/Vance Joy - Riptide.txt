Вступление(x2):|Bm|G#|C#|C#|

  Bm                G#               C#
1.I was scared of dentists and the dark.
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations.
Oh, all my friends are turning green.
You're the magician's assistant in their dream.

A-wooh!
Oh, and they come unstuck!

Chorus:
 Bm     G#                  C#
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side I wanna be your left hand man.
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause You're gonna sing the words wrong.

2.Is this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City.
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf.

A-wooh!
Oh, and they come unstuck!

Chorus:
Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side I wanna be your left hand man.
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat 'cause You're gonna sing the words wrong.

 Bm                         G#
I just wanna, I just wanna know
 C#                                F#
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way

    Bm         G#                  C#
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Chorus(x2).
