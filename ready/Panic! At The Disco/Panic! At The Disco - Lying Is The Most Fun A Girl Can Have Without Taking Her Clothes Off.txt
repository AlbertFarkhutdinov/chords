1.Is it still me that makes you sweat? Am I who you think about in bed?
        G#
When the lights are dimm and your hands are shaking as you're sliding off your dress?
Then think of what you did, and how I hope to God he was worth it
When the lights are dimm and your heart is racing as your fingers touch your skin

I've got more wit, a better kiss, a hotter touch, a better fuck
Than any boy you'll ever meet, sweetie, you had me
Girl I was it look past the sweat, a better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat
  G#
No no no, you know it will always just be me

So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?

So I guess we're back to us, so cameraman swing the focus!
         G#
In case I lost my train of thought where was it that we last left off?
It was pick up pick up

2.Oh now I do recall, we just were getting to the part
Where the shock sets in and the stomach acid finds a new way to make you get sick
I hope you didn't expect to get all of the attention
Let's not get selfish, did you really think I'd let you kill this chorus?
