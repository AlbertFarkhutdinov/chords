Capo on 4th fret.

Chorus:
 Em                   C             G
All you sinners stand up, sing hallelujah
Show praise with your body, stand up, sing hallelujah
And if you can't stop shaking, lean back, let move right through ya
Say your prayers, say your prayers, say your prayers

  Em                 C                G
1.My life started the day I got caught under the covers with second hand lovers
Oh tied up in pretty young thing in a state of emergency who was I trying to be
Then the time for being sad is over and you miss 'em like you miss no other
And being blue is better then being over it, over it

Chorus.

2.I was drunk and it didn't mean a thing, stop thinking about the bullets from my mouth
I love the things you hate about yourself just finished a day dream who were you trying to be?
Then the time for being sad is over and you miss 'em like you miss no other
And being blue is better then being over it, over it

No one wants you when you have no heart and I'm sitting pretty in my brand new scars and
You'll never know if you don't ever try again, so let's try, let's try, let's try

Chorus(x2).
