Finders Keepers, Losers Weepers...

   D#m
1.Welcome to the end of eras
                          F#
Ice has melted back to life
Done my time and served my sentence             
Dress me up and watch me die
        H
If it feels good, tastes good
 G#m        F# F
It must be mine
 D#m
Dynasty decapitated
You just might see a ghost tonight
 H                             B7
And if you don't know now you know

Chorus:
                   H
I'm taking back the crown
                       G#m
I'm all dressed up and naked
                      D#m
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers)
      (D#m F F# B)
Oh yeah
The crown...
So close I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers)
Oh yeah

2.Sycophants on velvet sofas
Lavish mansions, vintage wine
I am so much more than Royal
Snatch your chain and mace your eyes
If it feels good, tastes good
It must be mine
Heroes always get remembered
But you know legends never die.

And if you don't know now you know

Chorus.

 D#m
Mortal kings are ruling castles
Welcome to my world of fun
Liars settle into sockets
Flip the switch and watch them run...

 H                G#m
O-ohh Ye-ea-aaah-ohooo-oh-oh-oh-ohh
