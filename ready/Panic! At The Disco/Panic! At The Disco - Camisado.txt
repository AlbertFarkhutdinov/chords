The I.V. and your hospital bed
 G                             Em                      A
This was no accident this was a therapeudic chain of events

 Hm
This is the scent of dead skin on the linoleum floor
 D
This is the scent of quarentine wings in a hospital
 G
It's not so pleasant and it's not so conventional
 Em                               A
It sure as hell ain't normal but we deal, we deal

The anesthetic never set in and I'm wondering when
The apathy and urgency is that I thought I phoned in
It's not so pleasant and it's not so conventional
It sure as hell ain't normal but we deal, we deal

 D
Just sit back just sit back
Just sit back and relax
Just sit back just sit back
                              Em F#
Just sit back and relax again...

Chorus:

Can't take the kid from the fight take the fight from the kid
 Hm
Sit back relapse, sit back relapse again
Can't take the kid from the fight take the fight from the kid
Just sit back, just sit back
