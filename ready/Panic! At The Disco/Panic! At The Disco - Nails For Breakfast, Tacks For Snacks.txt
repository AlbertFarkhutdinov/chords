Nails For Breakfast, Tacks For Snacks

Watch your mouth,
Because your speech is slurred enough,
That you just might swallow your tongue.

I'm sure you would want to give up the ghost,
With just a little more poise then that.
Or was it God who chokes in these situations?
Running late? Oh no, he called in,
he called in.

The hospices, a relaxing weekend get-a-way,
Where you're a cut above all the rest.
Sick and sad patients,
On first name basis,
With all the top physicians.

Perscribed pills to offset the shakes,
To offset the pills,
You know you should take it a day at a time.

That's when you stutter something profound,
To the support on the line,
And with the way you've been talking,
Every word gets you a step closer to Hell.
No, I just cant help it
To say what everyone else is speakin'
Let me state the obvious again.

Prescribed pills to offset the shakes,
To offset the pills,
You know you should take it a day at a time.

Prescribed pills to offset the shakes,
To offset the pills,
You know you should take it a day at a time.

I am alone in this bed, house and head,
She never fixes this,
But at least sheâ€¦
I am alone in this bedroom.
She never fixes this,
But at least sheâ€¦
Makes me forget...

Prescribed pills to offset the shakes,
To offset the pills,
You know you should take it a day at a time.

Prescribed pills to offset the shakes,
To offset the pills,
You know you should take it a day at a time.

The hospices, a relaxing weekend get-a-way,
Where you're a cut above all the rest.
Sick and sad patients,
On first name basis,
With all the top physicians.
