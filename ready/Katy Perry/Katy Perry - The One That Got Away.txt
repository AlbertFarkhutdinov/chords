1.Summer after high school when we first met
    G#m
We make out in you mustang to radio head
    C#m                                        A
And on my 18th birthday we bought matching tattoos
Used to steal your parent's liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

Chorus:
             E                   G#m
In another life I would be your girl
                 C#m                        A
We keep all our promises be us against the world
In another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away.

2.I was June you were my johnny cash
Never one without the other we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you I put those records on woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you down town singinâ€™ the blues
It's time to face the music I'm no longer your muse

Chorus.

E         G#m         C#m         A
  The one     the one     the one   the one that got away

 H                           C#m         F#m
All his money can't buy me a time machine no
Can't replace you with a million rings no
H                              C#m       A
I shoulda told you what you meant to me woah
H
Cause now I pay the price

Chorus.

E         G#m         C#m         A
  The one     the one     the one

In another life I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were the one that got away, the one that got away.
