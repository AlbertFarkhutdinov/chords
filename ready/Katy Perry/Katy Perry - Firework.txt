Capo 1

Intro:|G|F7|Em|C|

    G                F7  
1.Do you ever feel like a plastic bag, 
 Em                       C
Drifting through the wind wanting to start again? 
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin 
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing 
Do you know that there's still a chance for you, 
'Cause there's a spark in you 
 
Pre-chorus:
                G          Am          Em     C 
You just gotta ignite, the light, and let it shine 
Just own the night like the 4th of July 


Chorus:
                      G    Am
'Cause baby you're a firework
                   Em           C
Come on, show 'em what you're worth 
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
As you shoot across the sky-y-y 
Baby, you're a firework 
Come on, let your colors burst 
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh" 
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

2.You don't have to feel like a waste of space 
You're original, cannot be replaced 
If you only knew what the future holds 
After a hurricane comes a rainbow 
Maybe your reason why all the doors are closed 
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road 
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow 
And when it's time, you'll know 

Pre-chorus.
Chorus.

 Em
Boom, boom, boom!     
                      C
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon!
                           G
It's always been inside of you, you, you 
                            D
And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough!

Chorus.
 
G               Am
Boom, boom, boom!
                       Em              C
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon!
Boom, boom, boom!
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon!
