   Em                                     Cmaj7
1.I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf
                                  Am7
While jacking off listening to Mozart
You bitch and moan about LA
         H7 
Wishing you were in the rain reading Hemingway
You don't eat meat and drive electrical cars
You're so indie rock it's almost an art
You need SPF 45 
Just to stay alive!

Chorus:
  Em                         Cmaj7
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
                   Am7
No you don't even like
No you don't even like
                    H7
No you don't even like boys!
You're so gay and you don't even like boys
No you don't even like
No you don't even like
No you don't even like...

2.You're so sad maybe you should buy a happy meal
You're so skinny you should really super size the deal
Secretly you're so amused
That nobody understands you
I'm so mean cause I cannot get you outta your head
I'm so angry cause you rather myspace instead
I can't believe I fell in love
With some one that wears more makeup than...

Chorus.

3.You walk around like you're oh so debonair
You pull em down and there's really nothing there
I wish you would just be 
Real with me

Chorus(x2).
