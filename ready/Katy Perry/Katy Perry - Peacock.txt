1.Word on the street, You got something to show me, me
Magical, colorful, Mr. Mistery
I'm intrigued for a peek 'Cause it's fascinating
Come on baby let me see Whatchu hidin' underneath!

Words are mislead Such a tease Wanna see the show
In 3D, up on me Heard it's beautiful
Be the judge And my girls gonna take a poll
Come on baby late me see Watchu hidin’ underneath!

I want the jaw droppin', Eye-poppin', Head turnin', Body shockin', (Oh eh eh oh, oh oh eh eh oh)!
I want my heart throbbin', Ground shakin', Show stoppin', Amazing (Oh eh eh oh, oh oh eh eh oh)!
