Intro(x2):|Am|G|Em|F|

  Am          G                  Em                F
1.Sipping on rose, silver lake, sun coming up all lazy
Slow cooking pancakes for my boy, still up, still fresh, she's a daisy
Playing ping pong all night long, everything's on me and then hazy
Chanel this, Chanel that, hell yeah, all the girls vintage Chanel baby

Pre-Chorus:
     Am
It's no big deal, It's no big deal,
It's no big deal, this is no big deal

Chorus(x2):
               Am         G
This is how we do, yeah, chilling, laid back
        Em                         F
Street stuntin' yeah we Do it like that
               Am     G         Em             F
This is how we do, Do Do Do do, this is how we Do

2.Big hoops, and the room leaves, my click happening, my Maseratti
Santa Barbara chique, at the super rica, grabbing tacos, checking out hotties
Now we talking astrology, getting our nails did, all japanese-y
Day drinking at the Wildcats, sucking real bad at Mariah karaoke

Pre-Chorus.

Chorus(x2).
