1.You've given me sweet, sweet ecstacy, yeah, you take me to utopia
You're reading me like erotica, boy you make me feel exotica

We go deeper and harder than ever before
       E
We go higher and higher, I feel like I'm already there

I'm walking on air
I'm walking on air, tonight 
I'm walking on air 
I'm walking, I'm walking on air, tonight, 
I'm walking on air 
I'm walking on air (To-to-to-night, to-to-to)

2.This is pure paradise, even heaven is jealous of our love
Yes we make angels cry, raining down on us from up above
Just when I think I can't take anymore
We go deeper and harder than ever before
We go higher and higher, I feel like I'm already there
