          ะก              G
1.You're a one of a one, a one of a kind, 
 Am                            F
That you only find once in a lifetime
Made to fit like a fingerprint
A code that clicks open a gold mine
         Am         G         F
They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
When I found you, it was all pitter-patter.

2.Secretly, I hit the lottery
'Cause you're brighter than all of the Northern Lights
You speak to me, even in my dreams
Wouldn't let you go for even the highest price.

They say one man's trash is another girl's treasure
So if it's up to me, I'm gonna keep.... you forever

Chorus:
              C                        G
'Cause I understand you, we see eye to eye
        Dm                  F              
Like a double rainbow in the sky
And wherever you go, so will I
'Cause a double rainbow is hard to find 

3.Was a phenomenon when you came along
Yeah, our chemistry was more than science
It was deafening, loud like lightning, 
It was striking, You couldn't deny it

They say one man's trash is another man's treasure
The two of us together, make everything glitter

Chorus.

 Am                             F
To the bottom of the sea, I'd go to find you, ah ah
Climb the highest peak to be right beside you, ah ah 
Every step I take, 
                     C G
I'm keeping you in mind 
         
Interlude:|C|G|Am|F|

Chorus.
