    Cmaj7
1.You think I'm pretty 
  Em           D
Without any make-up on 
You think I'm funny 
When I tell the punch line wrong 
I know you get me 
So I let my walls come down, down

Before you met me
I was alright, But things 
Were kinda heavy 
You brought me to life, Now 
Every February 
You'll be my valentine, valentine!

Pre-chorus:
         Cmaj7    Em     D
Let's go all the way tonight 
No regrets, just love 
We can dance until we die 
You and I, We'll be young forever!

Chorus:
  Cmaj7       Em            D
You make me feel like I'm living a 
Teenage Dream. The way you turn me on 
I can't sleep. Let's runaway 
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back!

My heart stops when you look at me. 
Just one touch, now baby I believe 
This is real, so take a chance 
And don't ever look back, don't ever look back!

2.We drove to Cali 
And got drunk on the beach 
Got a motel and 
Built a floor out of sheets 
I finally found you 
My missing puzzle piece, I'm complete!

Pre-chorus.

Chorus.

                 Cmaj7             Em      D
I might get your heart racing In my skin-tight jeans 
Be your teenage dream tonight!
Let you put your hands on me In my skin-tight jeans 
Be your teenage dream tonight!

Interlude(x2):|Cmaj7|Cmaj7|Em|D|

Chorus.

I might get your heart racing In my skin-tight jeans 
Be your teenage dream tonight!
Let you put your hands on me In my skin-tight jeans 
Be your teenage dream tonight!
