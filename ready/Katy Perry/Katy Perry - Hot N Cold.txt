   G               D
1.You change your mind 
       Am             C
Like a girl changes clothes 
Yeah you, PMS 
Like a bitch, I would know 
And you over-think 
Always speak critically 
I should know That you're 
No good for me!

Chorus:
              G
Cause you're hot then you're cold 
       D
You're yes then you're no 
       Am
You're in then you're out 
       C
You're up then you're down 
You're wrong when it's right 
It's black and it's white 
We fight, we break up 
We kiss, we make up 
(you) You don't really want 
To stay, no
(but you) But you don't really
Want to go-o 
You're hot then you're cold 
You're yes then you're no 
You're in then you're out
You're up then you're down 

Interlude:|G|D|Am|C|

2.We used to be 
Just like twins, so in sync
The same energy
Now's a dead battery 
Used to laugh about nothing
Now you're plain boring 
I should know That you're 
not gonna change 

Chorus.

Interlude(x2):|Em|C|G|D|

 Em                C
Someone call the doctor 
       G              D
Got a case of a love bipolar 
Stuck on a roller coaster 
Can't get off this ride 

3.You change your mind 
Like a girl changes clothes...

Cause you're hot then you're cold 
You're yes then you're no 
You're in then you're out 
You're up then you're down 
You're wrong when it's right 
It's black and it's white 
We fight, we break up 
We kiss, we make up!

Chorus.
