   C                             G        
1.Under a silver moon, tropical temperature
 Em                          D
I feel my lotus bloom, come closer
I want your energy, I want your aura
You are my destiny, my mantra, I

Pre-chorus:
 C                       G                                           Em
Never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
                       D                                    C
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your light
                  Am                                   Em
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight (oh, oh)

Chorus:
         C
Take me down to the river
D    Em
Underneath the blood-orange sun
 D      C  
Say my name like a scripture
 G       Em
Keep my heart beating like a drum

 D         Am                   G    Em
Legendary lovers, we could be legendary la, la, la, la, la
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary la, la, la, la, la

2.Go down in history go down together 
Into infinity, forever
Your Cleopatra, your blushing Juliet
Anything for your love, a ride or die, Oh I
