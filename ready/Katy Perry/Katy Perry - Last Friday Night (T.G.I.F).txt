Intro:|H|G#m|D#m|C#|

               H
1.There's a stranger in my bed,
            G#m
There's a pounding in my head
           D#m
Glitter all over the room
          C#
Pink flamingos in the pool

I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbie's on the barbecue
There's a hickie or a bruise

Pre-Chorus.
          H                   G#m
Pictures of last night ended up online
       D#m       C#
I'm screwed, Oh well!
It's a blacked out blur, but I'm pretty sure 
It ruled. Damn!

Chorus:
  C#
Last Friday night!
   H
Yeah, we danced on tabletops
  G#m
And we took too many shots
  D#m
Think we kissed but I forgot
  C#
Last Friday night
Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois
Last Friday night
Yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop
Whoa-oh-oah
This Friday night!

Post-Chorus:
 H    G#m   D#m  C#
Do it all again! This Friday night!
Do it all again!

2.Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pre-Chorus.
Chorus.
Post-Chorus(x2).

 H        G#m      D#m       C#
T.G.I.F! T.G.I.F! T.G.I.F! T.G.I.F!
T.G.I.F! T.G.I.F! T.G.I.F! T.G.I.F!

Solo(x2):|H|G#m|D#m|C#|

Chorus.

Do it all again!
