1.You're so hypnotizing, 
Could you be the devil? 
Could you be an angel?

Your touch magnetizing 
Feels like I am floating 
Leaves my body glowing 

They say be afraid 
You're not like the others 
Futuristic lover 

Different DNA 
They don't understand you!

Pre-chorus:
              C#          D#        Fm
Your from a whole other world, a different dimension 
     C#       D#           C#                  C
You open my eyes And I'm ready to go lead me into the light 

Chorus:
   C#        D#
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me 
  Fm                          G# 
Infect me with your love and fill me with your poison 
Take me, ta-ta-take me 
Wanna be a victim, ready for abduction 
Boy, you're an alien 
Your touch so foreign 
It's supernatural 
Extraterrestrial 

2.Your so supersonic 
Wanna feel your powers 
Stun me with your lasers 
Your kiss is cosmic 
Every move is magic 

Pre-chorus.
Chorus.

  C#
There is this transcendental, On another level 
 Fm                      D# Fm
Boy, you're my lucky star 
I wanna walk on your wave length and be there when you vibrate 
 Fm                      D# C
For you I'll risk it all, All!

Chorus.

Extraterrestrial 
Extraterrestrial 

Boy, you're an alien 
Your touch so foreign 
It's supernatural 
Extraterrestrial
