Intro:|B|F|B|F|

  B                        F
1.I saw a spider I didn't scream
      B
Cause I can belch the alphabet
    F
Just double dog dare me
And I chose guitar over ballet
And I take these suckers down 
cause they just get in my way

 Dm       A   
The way you look at me
 B                 G
Is kind of like a little sister
Rubbed by your goodbyes
And it leaves me nothing but blisters, so...

Chorus:
   F
I don't want to be
     A
just one of the boys
 B
One of the guys
     C#                   B
Just give me a chance to prove to you tonight that
I just want to be 
one of the girls
Pretty in pearls
 C#     B        F
Not one of the boys

2.So over the summer something changed
I started reading Seventeen
And shaving my legs
And I studied Lolita religiously
And I walked right into school
and caught you staring at me

Cause I know what you know
But now you're going to have to take a number
It's okay maybe one day
but not until you give me my diamond ring, cause...

Chorus.

Bridge:
B           A    Dm            G
I want to be a flower, not a dirty weed
I want to smell like roses not a baseball team
And I swear maybe one day you're going to want to make out, make out,
             F  A B C# B
make out with me

Chorus.
