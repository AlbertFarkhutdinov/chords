1.I knew you were. You're gonna come to me         
And here you are, but you better choose carefully
'Cause I am capable of anything
Of anything and everything!

Make me your Aphrodi-te
Make me your one and only              
Don't, make me your enemy, 
Your enemy, your enemy

Chorus:
 F               C
So you want to play with magic? 
 Am               G 
Boy, you should know what you're falling for
Baby Do you dare to Do this?
Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for 
A perfect storm, perfect storm 
Cause once your mine, once your mine...
There's no going back

Interlude:|Am|G|F|Am|G|F|
           
2.Mark my words this love will make you levitate
Like a bird, like a bird without a cage
But down to earth, if you choose to walk away,    
Don't walk away!
It's in the palm of your hand now baby
It's a "yes" or "no", no "maybe"
So just be sure, before you give it up to me,
Up to me, give it up to me!

Chorus.

3.She's a beast. I call her Karma
She eat your heart, out like Jeffrey Dahmer
Be careful, try not to lead her on
Shawty's heart was on steroids, cause her love was so strong

You may fall in love when you meet her, if you get the chance you better keep her                  
She swears by it but if you break her heart, She turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor                          
She can be my Sleeping Beauty, I'm gon' put her in a coma,  Woo!

 F                          
Damn I think I love her, shawty so bad
  C
I'm sprung and I don't care she got me
 Am 
Like a roller coaster
 G 
Turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug
I was tryna' hit it and quit it
But lil' mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted 

Chorus.
