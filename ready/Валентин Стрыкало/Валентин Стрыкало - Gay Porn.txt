    B                D# 
1.Tears are falling down
             Cm
And I can't run
           F
From the feelings.
Day we fell apart
Still in my heart
I was too silly.

Pre-chorus:
 D#
And now
        F
You're with another guy
He seems to be
Better than I
These thoughts
Are still inside my head
And now 
Everything I have is just.

Chorus:
  B
Gay Porn in the morning, 
  F
Gay Porn in the evening, 
  Gm                D#
Gay Porn after lanch
              F
Thats how I killed my feelings.
Gay Porn in the bedroom, 
Gay Porn in the kitchen, 
Gay Porn in the bathroom
               F
Thats how I spent my weekend.
B   D#         F
Thats how I spent my weekend.
