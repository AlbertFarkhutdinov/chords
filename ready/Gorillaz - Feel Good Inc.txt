Intro(x4) = Riff 1

1.City's breaking down on a camel's back. 
They just have to go 'cos they don't hold back 
So all you fill the streets it's appealing to see 
You wont get out the country, 'cos you're bad and free 
You've got a new horizon. It's ephemeral style. 
A melancholy town where we never smile. 
And all I wanna hear is the message beep. 
My dreams, they've got to kiss, 'cos I don't get sleep, no..

Chorus:
 D#m               Bm
Windmill, Windmill for the land. 
 G#m            Bm
Learn forever hand in hand 
Take it all in on your stride 
It is sticking, falling down 
Love forever, love is free 
Let's turn forever you and me 
Windmill, windmill for the land 
Is everybody in? 

2.Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats, Lining them up-a like ass cracks, 
Ladies, homies, at the track. It's my chocolate attack. 
Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here Care bear bumping in the heart of this here 
Watch me as I gravitate. Hahahahahahaa! 
Yo, we gonna go ghost town, This motown, With yo sound You're in the place 
You gonna bite the dust Can't fight with us With yo sound You kill the INC. 
So dont stop, get it, get it Until you're cheddar header. 
Yo, watch the way I navigate. Hahahahahahaa!
