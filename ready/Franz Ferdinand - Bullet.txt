Intro(x2):|G|Em|Hm|D|

     G        Em
1.While I'm away you can't
 Hm               D
Let the mass go down on you
Hm                D
Let the mass do what I do
  D 
If I was there, 
Better explain
Better have a vendetta in narrow bones
And a vindictive eye
Hm                D
Jealousy I have no control! No control!

Chorus:
 B                 
Never kissed a bullet out of my
 G
Hand now baby
B                              G
I never catch a bullet out of my mind
Dm               
Never kissed a bullet out of my
G
Hand now baby
Dm                             G
I never catch a bullet out of my mind
B                          F
Will catch a history out of my head now
                       C
I have no control but I try
Oh yes I try
No!

Interlude(x2):|G|Em|Hm|D|

2.Yeah I'd better explain
That I have a red vendetta
In my narrow bones
And a vindictive eye
Jealousy I have no control!
No control!
      
Never kissed a bullet out of my
Hand now baby
I never catch a bullet out of my mind
Never kissed a bullet out of my
Hand now baby
I never catch a bullet out of my mind

G               F
Get out of my head
                 C
Get out of my head now
Get out of my head
Get out of my head now
Get out of my head
Get out of my head now
                    G
Now get out of my mind
