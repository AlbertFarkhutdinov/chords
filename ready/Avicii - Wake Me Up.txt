Intro(x2):|Hm|G|D|A|

   Hm         G               D  
1.Feeling my way through the darkness
Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start
They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me.

Chorus:
           Hm       G        D   A
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself and I 
Didn't know I was lost.
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself and I 
Didn't know I was lost.

2.I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
And I don't have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is a prize.

Chorus.

Outro   

  Hm          G     D   A        
I didn't know I was lost       
I didn't know I was lost       
I didn't know I was lost       
I didn't know, didn't know, didn't know...
