Fighting tears just to carry on, 
  A        E        F#       H

Girl with a groove with the big bust on, 
Big bust on, big bust on. 
Wait till your mother and your papa's gone, papa's gone,
Momma, momma papa, shock shock me, 
Shock shock me, shock shock. 

Chorus.

2.Carolina sits on ninety five 
Give her a dollar and she'll make you smile. 
Hooker, what a looker, walk away! 

Carry dresses like a kid for fun, 
Licks her lips like they're something other, 
Tries to tell you life has just begun, 
But you know she's getting something other 
Than the love from her mother.
