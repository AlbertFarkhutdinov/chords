Intro:|D#5|B5|D#5|B5|G5|B5|G5|D5|

   D#5                   B5
1.Oh yeah, guess that's okay 
We can talk about mammary glands 
 G5                       B5
No, I'm not obsessive compulsive 
 G5                      D5
I just like to wash my hands 
Yes, I like your neon sweater 
Well, maybe I should have mentionde 
I've got ADHD 
But I do deserve all the attention 
In a hurry but I'm not stressed 
Wearing black - I'm not depressed 
One girl's humor the other's bra 
It's decideophobia 

Pre-Chorus:
   D#5              B5
I know it seems surreal 
I can feel what you can't feel 
 G5                     B5
I feel what you can't feel 
 F
In a minute it's making sense 
I could be your peak experience 

Chorus(x2):
   D#5
I've got what you don't get 
You've got what I can't yet 
  G5
I'll do it - you don't fret 
 G5                           D5
Can't always want what you get 

2.Oh yeah, guess that's okay 
But you don't have to swallow 
Just because I'm paranoid 
Doesn't mean I'm not being followed 
Lately I'm slightly slickdecksick 
I say things like  Curring pat eh 
Do I like MGMT? I don't know 
How do you spell that? 
I'm a boy, I read prose 
You're a girl, you stand and pose 
You're with me when I spin tracks 
I'm with you when you get waxed 

Pre-Chorus.
Chorus(x2).

3.Oh yeah, guess that's okay 
Like seeing things that are not there 
But no, I'm not whatever-they-call-it 
Sometimes I just liketo swear 
You like things you get for free 
Well, I like phones that ring for me 
I say 'Hey grandma, bouffe-ma-chatte, 
You-horse-cock-mother-fucker, 
I'd love to come for tea' 

Pre-Chorus.
Chorus(x2).

I fly a plane into you 
You fly a plane into me 
I fly a plane into you 
You fly a plane into me 
I fly a plane into you 
You fly a plane into me 
I fly a plane into you 
You fly a plane into me
