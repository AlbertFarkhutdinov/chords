Chorus:
 Am                       G
All the right friends in all the right places
 C               F
So yeah, we're going down! They've got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down!

         Am                        G
1.Let's paint the picture of the perfect place
               C                         F
They've got it better then when anyone's told ya
They'll be the King of Hearts, and your the Queen of Spades
Then we'll fight for you like we were your soldiers

I know we've got it good, but they've got it made
And the grass is getting greener each day
I know things are looking up, but soon they'll take us down
Before anybody's knowing our name. They've got...

Where we're going, yeah, we're going down! They say...
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Where we're going, yeah, we're going down

2.Do you think I'm special? Do you think I'm nice?
Am I bright enough to shine in your spaces?
Between the noise you hear, and the sounds you like
Are we just sinking in an ocean of faces?

It can be possible... the rain can fall
Only when its over our heads.
The sun is shining everyday, but it's far away.
Over the world that's dead. They've got...

 Am                              G
It don't matter what you see, I know I could never be

Someone that could sound like you.
