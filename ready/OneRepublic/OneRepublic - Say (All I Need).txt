Intro:|A|E|F#m|D|

                        A                    
1.Do you know where your heart is?
                      E
Do you think you can find it?
                         F#m
Or did you trade it for something
           D
Somewhere better just to have it?
Do you know where your love is?
Do you think that you lost it?
You felt it so strong, but
Nothing's turned out how you wanted

Pre-Chorus:
        A                       E
Well, bless my soul, You're a lonely soul
           F#m             D
Cause you won't let go of anything you hold

Chorus:
      A                  E
Well, all I need is the air I breathe
        F#m             D
And a place to rest my head

2.Do you know what your fate is?
And are you trying to shake it?
You're doing your best and your best look
You're praying that you make it

Pre-Chorus.

Chorus:
Well, all I need is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head
Said I all I need is the air I breathe
And a place to rest my head

Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it?
Better than you had it
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it?
Do you think you can find it?
Yeah, better than you had it (Better than you had it)

Chorus.

Whenever the end is
Do you think you can see it?
Well, until you get there go on, 
Go ahead and scream it, just say it
