Intro(x2):|Hm|G|D|A|

  Hm       G           D   A 
1,I stared up at the sun
Thought of all the people, places and things I've loved
I stand up just to see
Of all the faces, you are the one next to me

                   Hm               G                      D             A
You can feel the light start to tremble watching what you know out to see...
You can see your life out of the window, tonight.

Chorus:
 Hm          G          D            A  
If I lose myself tonight, It'll be by your side   
If I lose myself tonight, woooh, woooh, woooh!
If I lose myself tonight, It'll be you and I...
 Hm       G       D 
Lose myself tonight!

2.I woke up with the sun
Thought of all the people, places and things I've loved
I woke up just to see 
Of all the faces, you are the one next to me
     
You can feel the light start to tremble watching what you know out to see...
You can see your life out of the window, tonight.

Chorus.

 Hm                    G      
Take us down and we keep trying
 D                  A
40 000 feet keep flying...     
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...     
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...    
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...   

Lose myself
If I lose myself tonight..
Whoooooooooo
