Intro:|E|G#m|

VERSE 1
   E                                   
This town is colder now, I think it's sick of us
   G#m
It's time to make our move, I'm shakin' off the rust
I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years

 C#m                          A
Steady hands, just take the wheel and every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal for the life I lead

Chorus:
  E
Stop and stare
                         G#m
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
                     C#m
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
                        A
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're 'here' not 'there'
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
                        E
Oh, can you see what I see?

2.They're tryin' to come back, all my senses push
Untie the weight bags, I never thought I could

Steady feet, don't fail me now gonna run till you can't walk
Something pulls my focus out and I'm standing down

Chorus:
Stop and stare
                         G#m
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
                     C#m
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
                        A
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're 'here' not 'there'
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, you don't need!

Interlude(x2):|E|G#m|C#m|A|

Chorus:
Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah, I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Oh, do you see what I see?
