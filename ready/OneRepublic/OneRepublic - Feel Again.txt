Capo on 5th fret

                C                                    F
1.It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face
          C                                 F 
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace 
        Am                                    F                    
Everything that I've had till my feet went numb
  C                                      F
Praying like a fool that's been on the run

Heart still beating but it's not working
It's like a million dollar phone that you just can't ring
I reach out trying to love but I feel nothing
Yeah, my heart is numb.

Chorus:
          C F    
But with you 
        Am
I feel again
Yeah with you 
I can feel again       

       C  F  Am  F 
Yeah! Woo-hooo!
  C                 F
I'm feeling better since you know me
  Am                 F
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me

2.It's been a long time coming since I've seen your face
I've been everywhere and back trying to replace 
Everything that I broke till my feet went numb
Praying like a fool who just shot a gun
Heart still beating but it's not working
It's like a hundred thousand voices that just can't sing
I reached out trying to love but I feel nothing
Oh my heart is numb

Chorus:  
But with you 
I feel again
Yeah with you 
I can feel again  
But with you (I'm feeling better since you know me)
I feel again (I was a lonely soul but that's the old me)
Yeah with you (I'm feeling better since you know me)
I can feel again (I was a lonely soul)

Woo-hooo!
 C  F  Am  F 
Woo-hooo!

I'm feeling better since you know me
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me
I'm feeling better since you know me
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me
I'm feeling better since you know me
I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me

Interlude:|C|F|Am|F

I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me
A little wiser now from what you showed me
Yeah, I feel again
Feel again...
