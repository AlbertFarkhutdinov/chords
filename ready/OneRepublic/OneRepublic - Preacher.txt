Capo on 1st fret

Intro(x4):|F|C|G|Am|

   F           C
1.When I was a kid
          G             Am
I used to buy and sell gravity
I knew how to fly
And I could teach you for a fee
Break every window
In my hotel heart
I was only 5 years old 
But 12 years scarred
And I'd hear the same voice
Echo in my mind
Said 'son you got an angel,
To chase the devil at the light'

Chorus:
   F           C
When I was a kid
          G            Am
My grandfather was a preacher
He'd talk about God
Yeah he was something like a teacher
He said 'God only helps those
Who learn to help themselves'
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth

2.I took a little faith
And put it in a parking lot
I drove to a strange town
Full of have and have nots
And as I walked through 
That storybook life
I was looking for an angel 
To chase the devil at the light! Oh oh oh!

Chorus.

Interlude(x2):|F|C|G|Am|

  F     C                 G        Am
Wave! Put your hands up and hands down!
Wave! Put your hands up and hands down!
Wave! Put your hands up and hands down!

Chorus.

Oh
He was a million miles from a million dollars
But you could never spend his wealth

Outro(x2):|F|C|G|Am|
