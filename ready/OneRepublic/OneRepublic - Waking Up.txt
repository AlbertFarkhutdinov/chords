1.I found varity on Nolan's Avenue
Down where the air is sweet as L.A. skies are blue
The water tried to break it down, but it held through
 Hm
It gave a little for the sake of staying true

   F#
2.We cut ties, we tell lies
           Bm                         H
We hate change and we wanna claim, where we feel
We take toes, we rake yours
Yeah we dig holes and we're diggin right in your fears

Chorus:
  F#
We're waking up, we're waking up!
  Bm                 H
And right on time, and right on Time!
We'll take these roads, we'll break them up
And right on time, and right on Time!

Interlude:|F#|F#|Bm|H|

2.We got cars, we write laws
We won't pause, don't you know, we're always working this hard
We don't lose, we might bruise
Yeah but we'll rain fire on ya, till you're playing all of your cards

Chorus.
