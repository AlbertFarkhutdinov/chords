           E 
1.I do my best 
                      A
To find some kind of glow
                             C#m                G#m 
I'm givin' it some heart and soul, now, from the darkest grays
      A         
The sun bursts, clouds break

Yeah, we see that fire, 
From the streets of Babylon
To the road that we've been on long
The kaleidoscope claims another

Chorus:
             E
Whoa oh-oh oh!
                  A
This is life in color
                    C#m            G#m  
Today feels like no other from the darkest grays
      A
The sun bursts, clouds break
Whoa oh-oh oh! 
This is life in motion
And just when I couldn't run this race anymore
The sun bursts, clouds break! This is life in color!

2.You've seen my worst, 
Yet you see some hope in me
The black and white sets us free like the queen to the rook, your decision 
Was a sure thing honey yeah, a sure thing
No wonder I feel 
Like I'm missing a heavy load
But no matter what daylight brings to us
We all know!

Chorus.
