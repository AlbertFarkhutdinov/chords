Capo on 1st fret.

Intro:|C|Dm|Am|F|

   C                      Dm
1.You and I were meant to be
                 Am                  F
Ain't no doubt about it, No need to hide that sort of thing
Now aim for something better
Ain't nothing better worth imagining

But I, I keep on running
I'm building bridges that I know you never wanted
Look for my heart, You stole it away
Now on every single road that I could take, listen

Chorus:
 C               Dm              Am         F
I want you to burn my bridges down (down), I said
I want you to burn my bridges down (down, down)
Set me on Fire! You set me!
Set me on Fire! You can burn my bridges down!

2.Send this out to sea
Send it where you wanted, You can take your note for note and not at all
There's no filling up your spaces with fictionary places
Imaginary faces, they don't work at all

I, I keep on running
I'm building bridges that I know you never wanted
Look for my heart, you stole it away
Now on every single road that I could take, listen

Chorus.

Interlude:|C|Dm|Am|F|

I want you to burn my bridges down (down)
I want you to burn my bridges down, yeah
Set me on Fire! You set me!
Set me on Fire! Set me on fire!

I want you to burn my bridges down (down), I said
I want you to burn my bridges down (down, down)
Set me on fire! 
Set me on fire!
