    C       Em                 F             C
1.Six on the second hand, Two new years resolutions
      Am              Em             F               C
And there's just no question, What this man should do
Take all the time lost, All the days that I cost
Take what I took and, Give it back to you

Chorus:
 C        Em             F               C
All this time, We were waiting for each other
 Am       Em           F          G
All this time, I was waiting for you
We got all these words, Can't waste them on another
        Am             Em                    F        C
So I'm straight in a straight line, Running back to you

2.I don't know what day it is, I had to check the paper
I don't know the city, But it isn't home
But you say I'm lucky, To love something that loves me
But I'm torn as I could be, Wherever I roam, Hear me say

Chorus.

 C     Em           F       C 
Yeah, all, running back to you
 Am    Em           F       C
Yeah, all, running back to you

Interlude:|F|Am|F|G|

     F                       Am
Oh, every time is so far, every time is so far
  F                        G
To get back to where you are

Chorus.

Am                Em                     F        C
I'm straight in a straight line, Running back to you
Straight in a straight line, Running back...to you.
