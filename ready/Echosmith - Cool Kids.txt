                 Em                                     Cmaj7      G
1.She sees them walking in a straight line, that's not really her style.
And they all got the same heartbeat, but hers is falling behind.
Nothing in this world could ever bring them down.
Yeah, they're invincible, and she's just in the background.
And she says:

Chorus 1:
   Em                         Cmaj7
"I wish that I could be like the cool kids,
    G                            D
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in.
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, 
Like the cool kids!"

2.He sees them talking with a big smile, but they haven't got a clue.
Yeah, they're living the good life, can't see what he is going through.
They're driving fast cars, but they don't know where they're going.
In the fast lane, living life without knowing.
And he says:

Chorus:
"I wish that I could be like the cool kids,
'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in.
I wish that I could be like the cool kids, 
Like the cool kids!
I wish that I could be like the cool kids,
'Cause all the cool kids they seem to get it.
I wish that I could be like the cool kids,
Like the cool kids!"
