Вступление(x6):|Dm|B|C|Dm|

   C#m7                            G#7
1.What will you do when you get lonely
   C#m7       C   D             E   E7
No one waiting by your side? 
   F#m     H      E            A
You will run and hide much too long. 
   F#m     H               E     A
You know it's just your foolish pride. 

Chorus:
 Dm B      C          Dm
Layla, you've got me on my knees. 
Layla, I'm begging, darling please. 
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind. 

2.Tried to give you consolation 
Your old man had let you down. 
Like a fool, I fell in love with you, 
You turned my whole world upside down. 

Chorus.

3.Make the best of the situation 
Before I finally go insane. 
Please don't say we'll never find a way 
Tell me all my love's in vain. 

Chorus(x2).
