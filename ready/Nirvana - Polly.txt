1.Polly wants a cracker.
Think I should get off her first.
I think she wants some water 
To put out the blow torch.

Chorus:
 D C     G B
Isn't me have a seed?
Let me clip dirty wings
Let me take a ride, ñut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true
Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself

Interlude(x2):|Em|G|D|C|

2.Polly wants a cracker
Maybe she would like some food
She asks me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

Chorus.

3.Polly says her back hurts
She's just as bored as me
She caught me off my guard
Amazes me, the will of instinct

Chorus.
