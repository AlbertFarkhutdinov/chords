Words I Might Have Ate

Intro:|A|G|x4

Verse 1:		
       A             G                A
Now it seems i can't keep my mind off you
   A                   G                      E
My mind drifts back to better days we've been through
Like sitting on blacktop of the school grounds
The love i bitched about i finally found

Chorus:		
    D5       A5   G     F#       F
But now it's gone and i take the blame
           D5            E5              A5
So there's nothing i can do but take the pain...why?

Interlude:|A|G|x2

Verse 2:		
Now i dwell on what you remind me of
A sweet young girl who sacrificed her love
As for me i am blind without a cause
And now i realized what i have lost

Chorus 2:	
It was something real that i could've had
Now i play the fool who's soul's gone bad...why?

Interlude:|A|G|x4

Bridge:		
E           A                  G
Tell me the words i might have said
It's pumping pressure deep inside my head
Was it bad enough to be too late
Just tell me the words i might have ate

A                      G
The words i might have ate...
The words i might have ate...

Interlude:|A|G|x4

Chorus:		
    D5       A5   G     F#       F
But now it's gone and i take the blame
           D5            E5              A5
So there's nothing i can do but take the pain...why?
