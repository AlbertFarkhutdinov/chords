Intro(x4):|Hm|D|A|E|

   Hm         D              A              E     
1.I'm waking up to ash and dust I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals...      
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse...Whoa!

Chorus:
            Hm             D            A                E 
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age! Welcome to the new age, to the new age!
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive!
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh, oh, I'm radioactive, radioactive!

2.I raise my flags, don my clothes, it's a revolution, I suppose
We're painted red to fit right in, whoa!    
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse...Whoa!

Chorus.

 Hm          D   A              E
All systems go, the sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside

Chorus.
