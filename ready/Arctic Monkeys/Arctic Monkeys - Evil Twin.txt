1.You never met before 
But still she treats you like a long lost rock'n'roll 
She's definitely one of those 
YOu go where ever she goes 
And my body and my mind 
Both start talking at the exact same time 
Trying to think of ways to make her mine 
But difficult to find!

Chorus:
It's not what I need!
No your love's not what I need!
So don't give it to me!

And she said...

2.Oh, well i know this will sound cold 
But I really have to go It's not that I'm not 
Sweet There's nowhere I need to be 
It's just your love's not what I need So don't give it to me 

Chorus.

And she said baby I could never leave you 
How can I believe you when you can't believe your love.
No point sticking to the plan when it's going slow 


3.It's more her hunger than her first 
She'll break it up the second time before you know about the first 
Looks well equipped to leave you in the luge 
But you better do it well 
And it's not hart to tell 
It's obvious the other angel's face is fell 
When she told him that she had to go 
Trouble wins in all the cold for something colorful 

Chorus.

Not what I need 
So don't give it to me 
No your love's not what I need 
So don't give it to me 
No your love's not what I need 
So don't give it to me 
Love's not what I need
