1.So Who's that girl there? 
I wonder what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets 
She don't do major credit cards, I doubt she does receipts 
It's all not quite legitimate 
And what a scummy man 
Just give him half a chance. I bet he'll rob you if he can 
Can see it in his eyes, yea, That he's got a driving ban 
Amongst some other offences 

And I've seen him with girls of the night 
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light 
They're all infected but he'll be alright 
Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
Said he's a scumbag, don't you know! 

2.Although you're trying not to listen 
Avert your eyes and staring at the ground 
She makes a subtle proposition 
"I'm sorry love I'll have to turn you down" 
Oh he must be up to summat 
What are the chances, sure it's more than likely 
I've got a feeling in my stomach 
I start to wonder what his story might be (what his story might be) 

Chorus:
They said it changes when the sun goes down!
They said it changes when the sun goes down!
They said it changes when the sun goes down!
Around here!
Around here!

2.Look here comes a Ford Mondeo 
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous? 
And he don't even have to say owt 
She's in the stance ready to get picked up 
Bet she's delighted when she sees him 
Pulling in and giving her the eye 
Because she must be fucking freezing 
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky 
It doesn't stop in the winter, no!

Chorus:
They said it changes when the sun goes down!
They said it changes when the sun goes down!
They said it changes when the sun goes down!
Around Here!
They said it changes when the sun goes down!
Over the river, going out of town.
They said it changes when the sun goes down!
Around Here!
Around Here!

3.What a scummy man 
Just give him half a chance I bet he'll rob you if he can 
Can see it in his eyes, yea, that he's got a nasty plan 
I hope you're not involved at all.
