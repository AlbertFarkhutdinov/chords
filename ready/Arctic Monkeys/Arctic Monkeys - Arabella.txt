1.Arabella's got some interstellar gatorskin boots 
And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger and I ride it endlessly 
She's got a Barbarella silver swinsuit 
And when she needs to shelter from reality She takes a dip in my daydreams 

Pre-Chorus:
My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind 
That little lady sitting on the passenger side 
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light 
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes 
As Arabella, oh 
As Arabella 

Chorus:
She Spinal-Tapped into your mind and soul 
You can't be sure!

2.Arabella's got a '70s head 
But she's a modern lover It's an exploration she's made of outer space 
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge 
And her kiss the color of a constellation falling into space 

Pre-Chorus.
Chorus.

3.(That's magic) in a cheetah print coat 
(Just a slip) underneath it I hope 
(Asking if) I can have one of those 
(Organic) cigarettes that she smokes 
(Rubs her lips) 'round a Mexican Coke 
(Makes you wish) that you were the bottle 
(Takes a sip) of your soul, and it sounds like 

Chorus.
