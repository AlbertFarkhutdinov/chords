         F#m                         D                 Hm    
1.I'm a puppet on a string, Tracy Island, time-traveling diamond
Coulda shaped heartaches, come to find ya fall in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining lone ranger riding
Through an open space, in my mind when she's not right there beside me

Chorus
  F#m              D                      Hm
I Go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I wanna hear her say is 
"Are you mine? "

Are you mine?            
Are you mine?
Are you mine? (Oh Are...)

Проигрыш:|F#m|F#m|D|Hm|

2.I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end, keep imagining meeting,
Wished away entire lifetimes, unfair we're not somewhere
Misbehaving for days, great escape lost track of
Time and space. She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

Chorus.

Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine?)

Проигрыш:|F#m|F#m|D|Hm|

 Hm                     D                           F#m 
And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
        A
So in case I'm mistaken,
 Hm                     D      C#     Bm    Am      F#m
I just wanna hear you say "You got me baby are you mine?"

Проигрыш(x2):|F#m|F#m|D|Hm|

She's a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

Chorus.

Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow or just mine tonight?)
