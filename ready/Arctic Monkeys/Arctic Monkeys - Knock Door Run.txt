1.Watch me! Watch me go
Well I'm struttin' up ever so slow
And now sting me get in the groove
Cause they're bangin' on the door
Yes they're hard and they'll make a move

Pre-Chorus:
We're wakin' up those sleepers
You know we're so mischievous
Just what you'll do to keep us entertained
We're wakin' up those sleepers
You know we're so mischievous
Just what you'll do to keep us entertained

Chorus:
(Knock, run)
She's got you up and she's run, run, runnin' away
(Knock, run)
You're knockin' first if you think that you're comin' to play
And I don't mind
Cause all the time you're talkin' at me
No I don't mind at all

2.Oh well cap-guns and polystyrene planes
Well I'm buyin' penny bubblies with my change
Cause sting me... get in the groove
Cause they're bangin' on the door
Yes they're hard and they'll make a move

Pre-Chorus:
We're wakin' up those sleepers
You know we're so mischievous
Just what you'll do to keep us entertained
Oh well now she says she's goin'
That she's got the towel to throw in
Was just about to blow him and run away! 

Chorus.
