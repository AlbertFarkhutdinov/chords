Intro(x2):|Gm|D#|Cm|Gm|

  Gm                             D# Cm
1.'ve you got colour in your cheeks? 
  Cm                                      Gm
Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the tide that sticks around like 
Something in your teeth and there some aces up your sleeve 
've you no idea that you're in deep. I dreamt about you nearly 
Every night this week. How many secrets can you keep?
Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow 
When I play it on repeat, until I fall asleep
 Cm                 D
Spilling drinks on my settee 

Pre-Chorus: 
          D# 
(Do I wanna Know?) 
          Cm
If this feeling floats both ways 
          Gm
(Sad to see you go) 
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
          D#  
(Baby we both know) 
          Cm
That the nights were mainly made 
          Gm
for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day 

Chorus: 
                  Gm
Crawling back to you 
                     D#   Cm
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
               Gm
Cause I always do
                              D#        Cm
Well baby I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
                     Gm
Now I've thought it through
                  Gm
Crawling back to you 

2.So I've you got the goods? 
Been wondering if you're heart's still open and if so I wanna 
Know what time it shuts simmer down and pucker up 
I'm sorry to interrupt It's just I'm constantly on the cusp
Of trying to kiss you 
I don't know if you feel the same as I do 
We could be together 
If you wanted to 

Pre-Chorus.
Chorus.
