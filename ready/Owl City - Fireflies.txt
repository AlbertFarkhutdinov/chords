Capo on the 3rd fret

Вступление(x4):|G|C|F|F|

  G                          C
1.You would not believe your eyes
  F                            
If ten million fireflies 
     G            C      F
Lit up the world as i fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I'd just stand and stare.

Chorus:
 F              C         G
I'd like to make myself believe that planet
 F     C     Em    F
Earth turns slowly
        F               C            F      G      Am
Its hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
 F                   C          D
'Cause everything is never as it seems.

2.'Cause i'd get a thousand hugs 
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance.
A foxtrot above my head
A sockhop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread.

Chorus:
F              Am         G
I'd like to make myself believe that planet
Earth turns slowly
Its hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
 F                   C             G
'Cause everything is never as it seems
           F
When i fall asleep...

3.Leave my door open just a crack
(please take me away from here)
'Cause i feel like such an insomniac
(please take me away from here)
why do i tire of counting sheep
(please take me away from here)
when I'm far too tired to fall asleep

To ten million fireflies
I'm weird 'cause i hate goodbyes
i got misty eyes as they said farewell
but ill know where several are
if my dreams get real bizarre
'cause i saved a few and i keep them in a jar

Chorus:
I'd like to make myself believe that planet 
Earth turns slowly
Its hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
F                   C             D
'Cause everything is never as it seems
           F
When i fall asleep

I'd like to make myself believe that planet
Earth turns slowly
Its hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
 F                   C             G
'Cause everything is never as it seems
           F
When i fall asleep


I'd like to make myself believe that planet
Earth turns slowly
Its hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
 F                   C                 G
Because my dreams are bursting at the seams...
