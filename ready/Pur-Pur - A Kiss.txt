Вступление(x2):|Em|Hm|D|A|

   Em
1.A splash!
              Bm
For a brief moment...
    D
And I was thinking
   A       G        
What if It was your life.
  Em      
A crash!
            Hm
We didn't notice
    D    
It was a star
  A     G               Em       Hm
Falling It could've been my life.
             D          A G
It could've been my life.

Припев:
Em          Hm
Look at the stars
D            A  
They remind me of eyes
Em       Hm     D     A 
On the omniscient face of the sky.
Em              Hm
That is smiling to us
D                A   
With its moon pearly lips, saying
  Em               Hm
"Give her a kiss, give her a kiss,
   D          A      
Give her a ki-iss!
  Em               Hm
"Give her a kiss, give her a kiss,
   D          A      
Give her a ki-iss!

2.A scream!
Don't be so silent
You've heard enough
To use it just feel it's coming out.
A steam!
Fulfilled with autumn
It brings us rains
And cozy
Nights for making love.

And cozy
Nights for making love.

Припев.

Проигрыш.

      Em                Hm
Oh dear the sky is so incredible tonight
      D                         A
And the clouds are floating about my head
      Em                 Hm            D     A
I wanna come back and make all things right
       Em               Hm
Raindrops are falling making me allover wet
       D                   A
My outstretched arms grew numb without moving
       Em         Hm         D                 A
And I don't regret. I don't regret. I don't regret! 

Проигрыш.
