   Am                      G
1.Tonight I kinda get the feeling
                  F   
My girl is up to something, something that is no good.
She said she only had a meeting
But she is dressed for something, something that is no good
Now I'm not saying that she's cheating, but seeing is believing
Can't believe it, what I'm seeing when I stepped inside

Chorus:
F                C             G              F
She's so wasted, acting crazy, making a scene like it's her birthday
F                   C             G             F
Drinking champagne, going insane, falling on me like it's her birthday
F                                    C             
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh      This ain't the night I thought it'd be
G                               F
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh      She ain't shy, apparently
F                                     C
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh      She's in the crowd and everybody sings
G                               F (hit once)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh      Just like it's her birthday

1.She turns and says don't be surprised             
It's gonna be a good night A good, good night
She's showing me a different side
One I've never seen before, that I Ignore
Cause when I'm up she's all about me, when I'm down she stays around me
Now I know I'm one and only so I might as well enjoy the ride

Chorus.

G Am C F
Like it's her birthday
G Am C F
Like it's her birthday
G Am C F
Like it's her birthday
G Am C
Like it's her birthday

Solo(x2):|F|C|G|F|

Chorus.
