  C#m                F#
1.Black burn. I feel so alone
         G# 
Without you boy! "djele-hey"
Now I'm here
Hanging out in the street
Thinking about 
Reactions over actions
Walking on the sky 
Of my dreams.

Chorus:
 C#m                F#
Come, come, my baby come
                G#
I will show you the wo-orld "djeleng-djeleleng"
Come, come, my baby come
I will cover your nightmares "dleleleng-djeleng"
Come, come, my baby come
I will love you forever "tolo-tolohohoh"
Come, come, my baby come
I will not let you go "oh oh oh oh"

2.My love, I just feel so lost
Without you boy "djele-hey"
I - I am yours even 
If time has passed
Take me away 
From this impetuous world
Leaving this jail 
Of my mind

Chorus.

 F#m      E             D#              G# 
My soul, my soul is in Africa, with you boy!

Chorus.

3.My soul, is in Africa
With you boy "djele-hey"
Looking at the stars
On this diamond sky
Giving you my smile
So you can keep it on your mind
Floating on your 
Blazing eyes.

Chorus.
