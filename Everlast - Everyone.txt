Intro:|Am|F|Am|F|

   Am
1.Please, please, please don't 
  F
Leave me now, girl 
 Am                       F
After all I've done for you 
On my knees here 
Let's work it out, woman 
After all that we've been through 

I told you that...

Chorus:
  Am
Everyone cheats, everyone lies 
  F
Everyone suffers and everyone cries 
Old people laugh, young people try 
Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes 
Everyone cheats, everyone lies 
Everyone hustles and everyone strives 
Bad people win, good people die 
Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes 

2.Hush your mouth, girl 
And settle down, woman 
'Cause you don't make no sense 
Make up your mind, girl 
And come around now 
Come down from off that fence 

Don't you know...

Chorus.

3.Watch your temper, girl 
And calm your nerves down 
Better watch how you react 
Put your hands down 
And back up off me, woman 
'Cause you might get touched back 

I told you that...

Chorus.

Solo:|Am|F|Am|F|

Chorus.

When they look in your eyes 
When they look in your eyes 
Lovers, they know when they look in your eyes
