Intro(x2):|F|Am|G|Dm|
 
Chorus:
 F                       Am
Kiss me hard before you go
 G             Dm
Summertime sadness.
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best.

         F               Am
1. I got my red dress on tonight
               G                     Dm
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feeling alive.
 
Pre-Chorus:
 F             Am
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
          G               Dm
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothing scares me anymore
 
Chorus.

Post-Chorus:
 F                      Am
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
 G                 Dm
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh
 
2. I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight.

Pre-Chorus.

Post-Chorus.
 
 Em                        Am
Think I'll miss you forever
         F                         Dm
Like the stars miss the sun in the mornin' skies
Later's better than never
     Gsus4
Even if you're gone I'm gonna dri-i-i-i-ive, dri-i-i-ive

Post-Chorus.
