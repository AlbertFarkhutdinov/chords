[Verse 1]
 
         F               Am
I got my red dress on tonight
               G                     Dm
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
                F                       Am
Done my hair up real big beauty queen style
            G                 Dm
High heels off, I'm feeling alive
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
F             Am
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
          G               Dm
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
      F              Am
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
        G             Dm
Nothing scares me anymore

G               Dm
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
            F           Am
I'm feelin' electric tonight
                  G                  Dm
Cruising down the coast goin' 'bout 99
           F                    Am
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
             G                    Dm
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight

Nothing scares me anymore

Em                        Am
  Think I'll miss you forever
         F                         Dm
Like the stars miss the sun in the mornin' skies
Em                       Am
   Later's better than never
