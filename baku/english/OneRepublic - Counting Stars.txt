Capo on 4th fret.

Chorus:
  Am                 C
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
  G                              F
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
Said, no more counting dollars, We'll be counting stars,
       F  
Yeah, we'll be counting stars.

Interlude(x2):|Am|C|G|F|

               Am
1. I see this life like a swinging vine
  C
Swing my heart across the line
 G
In my face is flashing signs
 F
Seek it out and ye shall find
Oh, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

Pre-chorus:
 Am C                G
I feel something so right
          F
Doing the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
  F
I could lie, could lie, could lie
 F
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Chorus(x2).

Interlude:|Am|C|G|F|

2. I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is a four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Oh, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

Pre-chorus:
I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Chorus.

   Am
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons are learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons are learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons are learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons are learned

  F             Dm
Everything that kills me makes feel alive

Chorus(x2).

 Am
Take that money, watch it burn
 C
Sink in the river, the lessons are learned
 G
Take that money, watch it burn
 F
Sink in the river, the lessons are learned

Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons are learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons are learned
