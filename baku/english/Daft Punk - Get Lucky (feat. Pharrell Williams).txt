Intro(x2):|Hm|D|F#m|E|

                            Hm  D
1. Like the legend of the phoenix
                 F#m E
Our ends were beginnings
What keeps the planet spinning
The force from the beginning.

Pre-Chorus:
 Hm             D
We've come too far
        F#m       E
To give up who we are
So let's raise the bar
And our cups to the stars

Chorus:
  Hm
She's up all night 'til the sun
    D
I'm up all night to get some
  F#m
She's up all night for good fun
  E
I'm up all night to get lucky
We're up all night 'til the sun
We're up all night to get some
We're up all night for good fun
We're up all night to get lucky!

We're up all night to get lucky!
We're up all night to get lucky!
We're up all night to get lucky!
We're up all night to get lucky!

Interlude:|Hm|D|F#m|E|

2. The present has no rhythm
Your gift keeps on giving
What is this I'm feeling?
If you want to leave, I'm with it

Pre-Chorus.
Chorus.

We're up all night to get! (x4)

We're up all night to get back together
We're up all night (let's get back together!)
We're up all night to get funky
We're up all night to get lucky

We're up all night to get lucky!(x8)

Pre-Chorus.

We're up all night to get lucky! (x8)
