Intro:|G|Cm|Fm|G7|

   G                       Cm
1. I was so high I did not recognize
                       Fm
The fire burning in her eyes
                   G7
The chaos that controlled my mind
whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart.
 
Chorus:
 Cm  Fm       A#        D#
This love has taken its toll on me
She said Goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
 Cm       Fm           A#              G#      G
I have no choice cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Interlude:|G|Cm|Fm|G7|
 
2. I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again

Chorus.

Interlude:|G|Cm|Fm|G7|

 Fm
I'll fix these broken things
 D#maj7
Repair your broken wings
 G7                          Cm
And make sure everything's alright (it's alright)
 Fm
My pressure on her hips
 D#maj7
Sinking my fingertips
 G
Into every inch of you
 G7
Cause I know that's what you want me to do
 
Chorus(x3).
