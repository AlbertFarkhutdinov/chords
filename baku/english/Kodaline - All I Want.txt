1. All I want is nothing more
   C                 G/H    Am
To hear you knocking at my door
          F                          C
Cause' if I could see your face once more
        F                   C
I could die a happy man I'm sure

When you said your last goodbye
I died a little bit inside
I lay in tears in bed all night
 F                      C    G/H
Alone without you by my side

Chorus:
           Am
But if you loved me
          F
Why'd' ya leave me
        C
Take my body
        G
Take my body
All I want is
And all I need is
To find somebody
I'll find somebody
 
Interlude = Verse.
 
2. So you brought out the best of me,
A part of me I've never seen.
You took my soul and wiped it clean.
     F                      C       G/H
Our love was made for movie screens.
