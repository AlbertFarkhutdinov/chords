Intro:|G|H|C|Cm|

                        G                              H
1. When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eyes
                    C                         Cm
You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather in a beautiful world
I wish I was special, you're so fucking special
 
Chorus:
          G            H
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
                         C               Cm
What the hell am I doing here? I don't belong here
 
2. I don't care if it hurts, I wanna have control
I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice when I'm not around
You're so fucking special, I wish I was special
 
Chorus.

              G                     H
Oooh, oooh, she's running out the door...
  C                     Cm
She's running out, she run, run, run...
Run...
Run...
 
                       G                   H
3. Whatever makes you happy, whatever you want
                  C                     Cm
You're so fucking special, I wish I was special
 
Chorus.
