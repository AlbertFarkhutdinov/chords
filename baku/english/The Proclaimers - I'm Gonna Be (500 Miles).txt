1. When I wake up, well, I know I'm gonna be,
          A                H               E
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you!
When I go out, yeah, I know I'm gonna be,
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you!
If I get drunk, well I know I'm gonna be,
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you!
And if I haver, yeah I know I'm gonna be,
I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you!

But I would walk 500 miles
 A                 H 
And I would walk 500 more 
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door!

2.When I'm working, yes I know I'm gonna be, 
I'm gonna be the man who's working hard for you!
And when the money comes in for the work I do
I'll pass almost every penny on to you!
When I come home I know I'm gonna be,
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you!
And if I grow old, well, I know I'm gonna be,
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you

When I'm dreaming, well, I know I'm gonna dream,
I'm gonna dream about the time when I'm with you!
When I go out, well I know I'm gonna be,
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you!
And when I come home, yes I know I'm gonna be,
