1. The world was on fire and no one could save me but you.
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do.
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you.
I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you.
 
Chorus:
    Hm A                     E
No, I don't want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, I don't want to fall in love. (This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you.
With you. (This world is only gonna break your heart)
 
2. What a wicked game you play, to make me feel this way.
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you.
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way.
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you. 
 
Chorus.
 
Interlude(x4):|Hm|A|E|E|
 
3. The world was on fire and no one could save me but you.
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do.
I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you.
I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you, no.
 
Chorus.

    Hm  A  E
No, IIIIIIIII... (This world is only gonna break your heart)

Nobody loves no one.
