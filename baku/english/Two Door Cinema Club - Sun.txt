    D       Am
1. Ocean blue 
      C     Em
What have I done to you
Cut so deep    
Yet growing through and through

2. Drawn apart
New York and London
All I see now
Are distant drumlins
The roads I knew
Became a city 
Then I wonder
          G
Will you wait for me, oh

Chorus:
 C
Though
         Am
I'm far away
             Em 
I know I'll stay, I know I'll stay
                  G
Right there with you
Though
It might be too late
What would you say? What would you say?
What would you do?

3. I built a hive
Became one with the bees
But we fell like rain
Got lost into the sea
If I don't know
The wind will carry me
So just hold tight

Chorus.

 C                     Em
Over and over many setting suns
        D                          Am
I have run, I have waited for the rain to come 
When through that mist I see the shape of you
And I know, and I know that I'm in love with you 

Solo(x2):|C|Am|Em|G|

Chorus.
