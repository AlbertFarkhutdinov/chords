1. Hey Jude, don't make it bad
     F/C C7  C7sus4   C7      F
Take a   sad song and make it better
  A#                          F
Remember to let her into your heart
                 C                F
and then you can start to make it better
 
2. Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to  go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
           C              F        Fmaj7 F7
then you begin to make it better
 
Chorus:
                         A#        A#/A    Gm
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
      A#/F      C/E    C        F         Fmaj7 F7
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
   A#/F       C/E     C      F
by making his world a little colder

And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulders
