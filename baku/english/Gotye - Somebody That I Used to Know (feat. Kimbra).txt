1.Now and then I think of when we were together 
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die 
   Dm       C              Dm       C 
Told myself that you were right for me 
But felt so lonely in your company 
But that was love 
And it's an ache I still remember.

Interlude(x4):|Dm|C|Dm|C|

2.You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness 
Like resignation to the end Always the end 
So when we found That we could not make sense 
Well you said that we would still be friends 
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

Chorus:
 Dm       C             B    C
But you didn't have to cut me off 
Make out like it never happened 
And that we were nothing  I don't even need your love 
Treat me like a stranger And that feels so rough 
You didn't have to stoop so low 
Have your friends collect your records And then change your number 
I guess that I don't need that though 
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

2.Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over 
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done 
  C
I don't wanna live that way 
Reading into every word you say 
You said that you could let it go 
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody 
That you used to know... 

Chorus.

 Dm     C      B     C
Somebody! (I used to know)
Somebody! (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
Somebody! (I used to know)
Somebody! (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)

(I used to know)
(That I used to know)
(I used to know)
Somebody...
