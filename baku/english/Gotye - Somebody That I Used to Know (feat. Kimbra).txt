1. Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me. But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember.

2. You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end. Always the end.
So when we found that we could not make sense. Well, you said that we would still be friends.
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over.

Chorus:
 Dm       C             B    C
But you didn't have to cut me off.
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing. 
I don't even need your love 
Treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough. 
Now you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number.
I guess that I don't need that though.
Now you're just somebody that I used to know.

3. Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over 
But had me believing it was always something that I'd done.
  C
I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say 
You said that you could let it go 
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody 
That you used to know... 

Chorus.

 Dm     C      B     C
Somebody! (I used to know)
Somebody! (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)
Somebody! (I used to know)
Somebody! (Now you're just somebody that I used to know)

(I used to know)
(That I used to know)
(I used to know)
Somebody...
