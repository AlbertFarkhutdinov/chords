Intro(x2):|Am|F|Am|F|

    Am
1. Psychic spies from China
       F
Try to steal your mind's elation
Little girls from Sweden
Dream of silver screen quotations
    C                 G
And if you want these kind of dreams
     F        Dm
It's Californication.
 
Interlude:|Am|F|Am|F|
 
2. It's the edge of the world
And all of western civilization
The sun may rise in the East
At least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood
sells Californication.

Interlude:|Am|Fmaj7|Am|Fmaj7|
 
Pre-Chorus 1:
 Am
Pay your surgeon very well
   Fmaj7
To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin, is this your chin?
Or is that war you're waging?
 Am                Fmaj7
First born unicorn
 Am                Fmaj7
Hardcore soft porn
 
Chorus:
  C            G     Dm    Am
Dream of Californication
  C            G    Dm
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication

Interlude:|Am|F|Am|F|

3. Marry me girl, be my fairy to the world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard
It's Californication

Interlude:|Am|F|Am|F|
 
4. Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain can you hear the spheres
Singing songs off station to station?
And Alderaan's not far away
It's Californication

Interlude:|Am|Fmaj7|Am|Fmaj7|
 
Pre-Chorus 2:
 Am
Born and raised by those who praise
   Fmaj7
Control of population
 Am
Everybody's been there and
   Fmaj7
I don't mean on vacation
 Am                Fmaj7
First born unicorn
 Am                Fmaj7
Hardcore soft porn

5. Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
They're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world
From Californication
 
Interlude:|Am|Fmaj7|Am|Fmaj7|
 
Pre-Chorus 3:
 Am
Pay your surgeon very well
   Fmaj7
To break the spell of aging
 Am
Sicker than the rest, there is no test
    Fmaj7
But this is what you're craving
Am                Fmaj7
First born unicorn
Am                Fmaj7
Hardcore soft porn
 
Chorus.
