  G                D                Am
1. Mama take this badge off of me.
G         D               C
I can't use it anymore.
It's getting dark, too dark to see.
I feel I'm knockin on heaven's door.
 
Chorus(x2):
G               D                    Am
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
G               D                    C
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door
 
2. Mama put my guns in the ground.
I can't shoot them anymore.
That long black cloud is comin' down.
I feel I'm knockin' on heaven's door.
 
Chorus(x2).
