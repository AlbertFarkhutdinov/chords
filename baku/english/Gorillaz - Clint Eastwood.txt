Intro.

Chorus(x2):
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad.
I got sunshine in a bag.
I'm useless, but not for long!
The future is coming on!

It's coming on! (x4)

1. Finally someone let me out of my cage.
Now, time for me is nothing cos I'm counting no age.
Now I couldn't be there, now you shouldn't be scared.
I'm good at repairs and I'm under each snare.
Intangible. Bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view. Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose, sit and lose all you different crews
Chicks and dudes. Who you think is really kickin' tunes?

Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse You think it's fictional
Mystical? Maybe. Spiritual. Hero who 
Appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy
Lifeless to those the definition for what life is
Priceless to you because I put you on the high shit
You like it? Gunsmokin' righteous with one token
Psychic among those possess you with one go!

Chorus(x2).

It's coming on! (x4)

2. The essence the basics without did you make it
Allow me to make this, child like in nature
Rhythm You have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them. Every sprouting tree, every child of piece,
Every cloud and see, You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise, Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise Now I'm sucking to your lies
Through Russel, though not his muscles but the percussion he provides.

With me as a guide, y'all can see me now cos you don't 
See with your eye you perceive with your mind
That's the inner So I'mma stick around with Russ and 
Be a mentor bust a few rhymes so mother fuckers
Remember where the thought is I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember (that it's all in your head)

Chorus(x2).

It's coming on! (x4)

My future is coming on!
It's coming on!
It's coming on!
My future is coming on!
It's coming on!
It's coming on!
My future!
