     Em       C                
1. Another head hangs lowly, 
  G              D/F#
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence, 
Who are we mistaken 
But you see it's not me, it's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fighting 
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns 
in your head, in your head, they are crying
 
Chorus:
         Em            C        G              D/F#
In your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie.
What's in your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie.
 
Interlude(x2):|Em|C|G|D/F#|
 
2. Another mother's breaking 
heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence, 
we must be mistaken
It's the same old theme since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're still fighting
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they're dying
 
Chorus.
