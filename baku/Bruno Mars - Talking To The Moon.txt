    E
1. I know you're somewhere out there,
 G#7
Somewhere far away.
  C#m         H7
I want you back,
  A
I want you back.

My neighbors think I'm crazy,
But they don't understand.
You're all I have,
You're all I have.

Chorus:
 F#m                H
At night when the stars 
                 F#m          H
Light up my room, I sit by myself...
			     A H7 C#m
Talking to the moon,
                  A H7 C#m
Trying to get to you.
    A                  H
In hopes you're on the other side,
 E       H/D#  C#m7
Talking to me too.
 H          A
Or am I a fool,
	        H
Who sits alone,
Talking to the moon, ooh.

Interlude:|C#m|H|F#|

2. I'm feeling like I'm famous,
The talk of the town.
They say I've gone mad,
Yeah, I've gone mad.

But they don't know what I know.
Cause when the sun goes down
Someone's talking back,
Yeah, they're talking back, ooh.

Chorus.

 F#m   E      F#m
A-ahh, a-ahh, a-ahh.
 Hsus4               H 
Do you ever hear me calling?
A-ahh, ooh, a-ahh, ooh, a-ahh.
	  Hsus4            H              A H7 C#m
Cause every night I'm talking to the moon,
                         A H7 C#m
Still trying to get to you.

In hopes you're on the other side,
Talking to me too.
Or am I a fool,
Who sits alone,
Talking to the moon, ooh.
