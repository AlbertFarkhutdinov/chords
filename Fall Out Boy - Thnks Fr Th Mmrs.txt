    Bm            
1.I'm gonna make you bend and break (It sent you to me without wait )
  F
Say your prayers but let the good times roll, 
 D#m  C#
In case god doesn't 
 F
Show (Let the good times roll)
And I want these words to make things right 
But its the wrongs that make the wrongs that make the words come to life
"Who does he think he is," 
 F
If thats the worst you got, Then you better put your fingers back to the keys.

Chorus:
 Bm              F#
One night and one more time,
  D#m           
Thanks for the memories,
  F#               F          Bm
Even though they weren't so great
    F#                   G#
He tastes like you only sweeter!
One night yeah and one more time 
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
He, he tastes like you only sweeter! ohhhh 

Verse:
Been looking forward to the future
But my eyesight is going bad
And this crystal ball
It's always cloudy except for
When you look into the past ( look into the past )
One night stand ( one night stand off )

Chorus.

Verse:
              Bm      C#       D#m               F# F
They say! I only think in the form of crunching numbers 
In hotel rooms, collecting page six lovers
  Bm                F     D#m                    F# F
Get me out of my mind, and get you out of those clothes!
  Bm                F     D#m               F
I'm a liner away from getting you into the mood, whooaaahh  

Chorus.
