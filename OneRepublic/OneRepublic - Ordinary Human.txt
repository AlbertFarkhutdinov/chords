1.Today I took a walk in the clouds, today I took a walk in the clouds
                C#m                   A               E
Used to keep my eyes wide shut, but now I'm staring down
Today I felt a switch in my vein, today I felt a switch in my vein
Used to be a shadow now a shadow scream my name
               C#m             A              
And in the daylight I could swear, we're the same

Chorus:
                            E
But I'm just an ordinary human, ordinary ways
                     C#m                 A                E
I'm just an ordinary human but I don't feel so ordinary today
I'm just a picture perfect nothing, sometimes I medicate
I'll be a picture perfect human before the sun goes down today

2.Today I felt a switch in my vein, today I felt a switch in my vein 
Used to be a shadow now a shadow scream my name
               C#m             A                 
And in the daylight I could swear, we're the same

Chorus:
But I'm just an ordinary human, ordinary ways
I'm just an ordinary human but I don't feel so ordinary today
I'm just a picture perfect nothing, sometimes I medicate
I'll be a picture perfect human before the sun goes down today
                      C#m                        A              E
I'm just an ordinary human, but I don't feel so typical... oh today

Interlude(x2):|E|C#m|A|E|

             E
There'll be peace in the city tonight, peace in the city tonight
     A                                  E
But when I'm gone, I hope they get it right
There'll be peace in the city tonight, peace in the city tonight
But when I'm gone, I hope they get it right
                
But I'm just an ordinary human, ordinary ways
I'm just an ordinary human but I don't feel so ordinary today
But when I'm gone, I hope they get it right
