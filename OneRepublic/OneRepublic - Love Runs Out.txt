              Gm                           
1.I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
              Gm              
I'll be the bright in black that's makin' you run
           Cm                            
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright
              Gm 
'Cause we'll work it out, yeah we'll work it out
               D 
I'll be doin' this, if you had a doubt
               Gm 
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out

I'll be your ghost, your game, your stadium
I'll be your fifty-thousand clapping like one
And I feel alright, and I feel alright
'Cause I worked it out, yeah I worked it out
I'll be doin' this, if you had a doubt
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out

chorus:
          Gm 
I got my mind made up, man I can't let go
             Gm
I'm killing every second till it saves my soul
 Cm            
I'll be runnin', I'll be runnin'
           Gm
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out
       D      
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
          Gm
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out
 
2.There's a maniac out in front of me
Got an angel on my shoulder and Mestopholes
But mama raised me good, mama raised me right
Mama said "do what you want, say prayers at night"
And I'm saying them, 'cause I'm so devout
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out, yeah

Chorus.

Gm F C                D#
Ooh, we all want the same thing
Ooh, we all run for something
        D 
Run for God, for fate
     F
For love, for hate
     Gm
For gold, for rust for diamonds, for dust

              Gm        
I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
              Gm 
I'll be the bright in black that's makin' you run

Chorus.

I'll be your light, your match, your burning sun
I'll be the bright in black that's makin' you run
And we'll feel alright, and we'll feel alright
'Cause we'll work it out, yes we'll work it out
And we'll start a fire, and we'll shut it down
Till the love runs out, till the love runs out
Till the love runs out
