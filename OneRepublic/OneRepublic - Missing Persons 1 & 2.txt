Intro(x2):|F|Em|G|Am|

   F            Em 
1.Used to come around here every day
 G           Am
Now you're breakin'
Used to be the one that is not ashamed
Now you shamin'
Lost in all the wars we fought
Never sorrow
Now everything about you wears the scars
Of tomorrow
      F      Em         G Am
And I wonder where you are
Now I wonder where you are

Interlude(x2):|F|Em|G|Am|

2.Take yourself down, pick yourself up
Everything changed when you got along
7 point 1 took it all down
Suddenly you can't even be found
        F      Em   G Am
I said all night long

Interlude:|F|Em|G|Am|

Missing person's in the window staring at me
Saying things I cant hear
A missing person's in the window staring at me
Haven't seen them in years

Interlude(x2):|F|Em|G|Am|

  C
First things first, second in command
Right as I'm trying to change my plan
  F
Second gonna die, he can't breathe
  C
Everybody's staring straight at me
You spend it all chasing those lies
I don't really wanna take that chance
I don't really wanna do that dance
I don't know what to do till you say
  C                       F
Oh I don't wanna let you go
        C
But I can't keep holding on
Skies of silver, stars of gold
And now you know just what you like
  C            F       C
So far this love is all I have
So far this hurt is all I have

Interlude(x2):|C|C|F|C|

Missing person at the window
Missing person at the window
A missing person at the window
Missing person at the window
I wonder where you are
I wonder where you are
I wonder where you are
Wonder where you...
