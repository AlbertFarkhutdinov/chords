Intro(x2):|F#|H|D#m|C#|

   F#
1.Woke up in London yesterday
 H
Found myself in the city near Piccadilly
  D#m                     
Don't really know how I got here
  C#
I got some pictures on my phone
New names and numbers that I don't know
Address to places like Abbey Road
Day turns to night, night turns to live a we want
We're young enough to say

Chorus:
 F#                       H
oh, this is gotta be a good life
                    D#m
This is gotta be a good life
                        C#
This could really be a good life, good life!
Say oh this feeling that you cant find
This city is a fine life 
This could really be a good life, good, good life!

Interlude:|F#|H|D#m|C#|

2.To my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A. they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Col-or-ado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories but please tell me-e-e-e
What there is to complain about

 F#                        H
When you're happy like a fool
                 D#m
Let it take you over
                   C#
When everything is out You gotta take it in!

Chorus.

Interlude(x2):|F#|H|D#m|C#|

	F#
Hopelessly I feel like there might be something that I'll miss
Hopelessly I feel like the window closes oh so quick
Hopelessly I'm taking a mental picture of you now
'Cuz hopelessly The hope is we have so much to feel good about

Chorus.

3.Listen, to my friends in New York, I say hello
My friends in L.A. they don't know
Where I've been for the past few years or so
Paris to China to Col-or-ado
Sometimes there's airplanes I can't jump out
Sometimes there's bullshit that don't work now
We all got our stories but please tell me-e-e-e
What there is to complain about
