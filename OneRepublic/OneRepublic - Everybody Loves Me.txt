Intro(x4):|Riff|

   Riff
1.Hell sees her shadow on my backseat
And her friends are standing right in front of me
World wide from the Cimmaron to Turkey
Open up, said everybody loves me
  C                            Am
And you don't have to make a sound 
                           Riff
'Cause they got what you need, what you need. Oh, oh, oh, oh! 

2.Got love for the people that have warned you
God love all your sentimental virtue
Eight balls with the takers that'll make you
Lay cards with the lovers that'll hate you

And you don't have to make a sound 
They got what you need, what you need. Make you say

Chorus:
 E                        A
Oh my, feels just like I don't try 
               C
Look so good I might die 
                E
All I know is everybody loves me! 
Head down, swaying to my own sound 
Flashes in my face now 
All I know is everybody loves me!
 E    D#    D   C# C H
Everybody loves me

Interlude(x2):|Riff|

3.Well I, play the music, don't stop till I turn gray
Stars forever like John Sousa never fade
He had a beautiful child, named her Desiree
Hope I'm remembered for the things that I never made

'Cause you don't have to make a sound 
When they got what you need, what you need. Make you say

Chorus.

 E    D#    D   C# C H
Everybody loves me!
Everybody, Everybody, oh!
Everybody, Everybody!

  E
Don't need my health
        D               E
Got my name and got my wealth
I stare at the sun
Just for kicks all by myself
I lose track of time
So I might be past my prime
But I'm feeling, oh so good, Yeah

Chorus.

Outro:|E|A|C|

Don't you know who you are?
 E    D#    D   C# C H
Everybody, everybody
Everybody!
