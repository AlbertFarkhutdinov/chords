    Cm                              G#                 D#  B
1.I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground
I'm hearin what you say but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me, Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry, didn't think I'd turn around, and say...

Chorus:
     Cm                G#         D#    B
It's too late to apologize, it's too late!
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late!

Interlude:|Cm|G#|D#|B|

I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat, but it's nothin new
I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue, and you say...
"Sorry" like the angel heaven let me think was you, but I'm afraid...

Chorus.

I said it's too late to apologize, yeah!
I'm holdin on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground...
