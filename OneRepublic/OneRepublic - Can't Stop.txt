Intro:|Am|Am|C|F|

 Am
1.I guess this is what it's supposed to feel like
                    C                                 F
No we don't talk, no we don't talk, we don't talk anymore.
I guess this is what it's supposed to sound like
The universe, the universe, universe is torn.

I don't want to live without you
I can live without you half the day, Heeey hey!
I don't want to live without you
And put life off for another day. Hey-hey yeah! Hey-hey yeeeah! Heeey hey! 

Chorus:
      C
But I can't stop thinking about.. 
                Am           F
Thinking about us anymore! Oooh oh!
I said I can't stop thinking about.. 
Thinking about us anymore! Oooh oh!

I said I can't stop thinking about.. 
Thinking about us anymore! Oooh oh!
And all I've got.. uuuh
Is nothing I want anymore! Oooh oh!

2.No I never get used to silence
But I don't hear, no I don't hear I don't hear you anymore.
I know I had to look hard to find it 
Everything, everything, Everything is gone.

I don't want to live without you
And put life off for another day. Hey-hey yeah! Hey-hey yeeeah! Heeey hey! 

Chorus.

  Dm         Em                   G                           
I can see stars, I can see our lights
       Am                         Dm
and I swear that they're shining here
           Em               F 
I can see stars, I can see lights... shining here.

Chorus.
