                             G
1.I had a dream the other night
                              Em
About how we only get one life
                          C                               D
Woke me up right after two, stayed awake and stared at you
                            G
So I wouldn't lose my mind

And I had the week that came from hell
And yes I know that you can tell
But you're like the ned under the ledge, but I go flying of the edge
You go flying off as well

Pre-Chorus:
            Em           D
And if you only die once I wanna die with

Chorus:
G
You got something I need
            Em
In this world full of people there's one killing me
            C            D                G
And if we only die once, I wanna die with you (you, you, you)!
You got something I need                
In this world full of people there's one killing me
And if we only die once, I wanna die with you (you, you, you)!

2.Last night I think I drank too much
Call it our temporary crutch
With borken words I tried to say, Honey don't you be afraid
If we got nothing we got us (Yeah)!

Pre-chorus.
Chorus.

G
I know that we're not the same
      Em
But I'm so glad damn that we made it
     C          D         G
To this time, this time, now

You got something I need
Yeah in this world full of people there's one killing me
And if we only die once I wanna die with you (Yeah)!

Chorus.

If we only die once I wanna die with
If we only live once I wanna live with you
