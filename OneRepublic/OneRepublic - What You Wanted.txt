   C                F               Am
1.I'll find the places where you hide
I'll be the dawn on your worst night
The only thing left that I like
Yeah I would kill for you, that's right

Chorus:
                      C   F                   Am
If that's what you wanted, if that's what you wanted
If that's what you wanted, if that's what you wanted

2.I'll put your poison in my veins
They say the best love is insane, yeah
I'll light your fire till my last day
I'll let your fields burn around me, around me.

Chorus.
