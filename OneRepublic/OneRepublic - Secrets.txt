Intro:|D|F#m/C#|Hm|G|

               D
1.I need another story 
                  F#m/C#
Something to get off my chest 
                    Hm
My life gets kinda boring 
                        G
Need something that I can confess 
Til' all my sleeves are stained red 
From all the truth that I've said 
Come by it honestly I swear 
Thought you saw a wink, no, I've been on the brink, so 

Chorus:
                   D
Tell me what you want from here 
                     F#m/C#
Something that were like those years 
            Hm
Sick of all the insincere 
                  G      
So I'm gonna give all my secrets away 
This time, 
Don't need another perfect line
Don't care if critics never jump in line 
I'm gonna give all my secrets away 

2.My god, 
Amazing how we got this far 
It's like we're chasing all those stars
Who's driving shiny big black cars 
And everyday I see the news all the problems that we could solve 
And when a situation rises, just write it into an album 
Singing straight, too cold 
I don't really like my flow, no, so 

Chorus.

Interlude:|D|F#m/C#|Hm|G|

     D                        F#m/C#
Oooh, got no reason, got not shame 
                      Hm
Got no family I can blame 
                   G
Just don't let me disappear 
I'mma tell you everything!

Chorus(x2). 

All my secrets away!
All my secrets away!
