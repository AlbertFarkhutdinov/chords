    H
1.I was writing, thinking with my long hand
     G
Put pen to paper, everything was sinking
Then you start to wonder, how you gonna handle me?
When I'm under, swimming in the dark sea

Pre-Chorus:
  H
Everybody wants you to make it. It's all yours!
  G
Everybody wants to take it. It's all yours!
Everybody wants you to make it. It's all yours!
Everybody wants to take it, T-t-t-take it!

Chorus:
         H
Can you feel all the love?
         G
Can you feel all the love?
Can you feel all the love?
Can you feel all the love,
Like it was made for you,
Like it was made for you!
Like it was made for you!
Like it was made for you!

Interlude:|H|G|

2.Tell me something, something that can move me
Don't tell me lies or I swear you're gonna lose me
Guilty? like an ocean, jealous of the fish it feeds
Your devotion swimming inside of me.

Pre-Chorus and Chorus:
Everybody wants you to make it. It's all yours! (Can you feel all the love?)
Everybody wants to take it. It's all yours! (Can you feel all the love?)
Everybody wants you to make it. It's all yours! (Can you feel all the love?)
Everybody wants to take it, T-t-t-take it! (Can you feel all the love?)
Like it was made for you,
Like it was made for you!
Like it was made for you!
Like it was made for you!

Can you feel? Can you feel? Can you feeeel?

All the right friends in all the right places,
All the right moves and all the right faces.
All the right friends in all the right places,
All the right moves and all the right faces.

All the right friends in all the right places, (Can you feel all the love?)
All the right moves and all the right faces. (Can you feel all the love?)
All the right friends in all the right places, (Can you feel all the love?)
All the right moves and all the right faces! (Can you feel all the love?)
