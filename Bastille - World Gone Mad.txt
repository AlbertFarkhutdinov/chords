Intro(x2):|D|A|F#m|E|

           D                         A
1.So this is where we are
        F#m                       E
It's not where we had wanted to be
If half the world's gone mad
The other half just don't care, you see

Pre-Chorus:
   D                         E          F#m
You don't want to fuck with us.
British to the very last.

Chorus(x2):
                D                                         A   E
When it feels like the world's gone mad
                                               D
And there's nothing you can do about it,
                           F#m         E
No, there's nothing you can do about it.

          D                          C#m
2.So tell me what's the news
            F#m             E
And what is it you want me to see.
We're lying to ourselves
And dancing by the light of the screen.

Pre-Chorus.

Chorus(x2).

    D
Another man holding a microphone
   F#m                                   E
Trying to say something at all
Or finding himself on an empty road
Trying to choose which way to go.

   D                       C#m                E
So, you wanna make some money?
                       F#m
You wanna make some money.
   D                      E           F#m
So, you wanna be somebody?
                        A
You wanna make some money

Chorus(x2).
